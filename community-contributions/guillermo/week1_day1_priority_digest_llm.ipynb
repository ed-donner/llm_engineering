    "\n",
    "**Priority Digest LLM** is a lightweight tool designed to reduce cognitive overload and help knowledge workers focus on what truly matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern work is filled with constant interruptions — emails, chats, notifications — and it’s easy to end the day feeling busy but not productive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool analyzes two simple inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Your core job objective**  \n",
    "   *(the real purpose of your role, not a generic job description)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A short selection of your daily messages**  \n",
    "   *(emails, chat excerpts, notes — only what feels relevant)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this information, the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts potential tasks  \n",
    "- Evaluates which ones truly support your role’s objectives  \n",
    "- Classifies them using the **Eisenhower Priority Matrix**  \n",
    "- Highlights what to do now, plan, delegate, or drop  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not to tell you how to work, but to give you clarity, reduce noise, and help you prioritize with intention.\n",
    "\n",
    "You remain the final decision-maker — this is a guide, not a replacement for professional judgment.\n"
