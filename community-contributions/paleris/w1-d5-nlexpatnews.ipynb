       "**House price rise levels off with predicted 3% increase in 2026**  \n",
       "House prices surged almost 8% in Q3 2025 but are now leveling off, with economists forecasting a modest 3% rise this year and 4% next year. Newly built homes are pricier (€523,000) than existing ones (€487,000). Plans to phase out mortgage interest tax relief will barely affect prices, thanks to offsetting income tax cuts.  \n",
       "*Why it matters*: If you're looking to buy, the market might cool slightly but prices are still going up. If you're renting, expect more turnover as landlords sell off properties due to new rent control laws.  \n",
       "*What you can do*: Consider buying sooner rather than later if you're a first-timer, as prices won't be dropping any time soon. Landlords selling means more houses on the market for buyers.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**More houses sold to young first-time buyers as landlords sell up**  \n",
       "Young buyers now account for over half of home sales, with 11% under 25 years old (up from 4%). Landlords are offloading homes thanks to stricter rent regulations, increasing the cheaper housing supply. However, many young buyers rely on parental support and sometimes skip thorough checks on property condition.  \n",
       "*Why it matters*: It's slightly easier for young expats to enter the housing market, but be cautious: buying a home without proper inspections is a recipe for expensive surprises.  \n",
       "*What you can do*: If you're a first-time buyer, get a proper survey before signing anything and don't just rely on a parent's financial help. Cheap houses are coming but may come with hidden issues.  \n",

       "**Spending in cafés rises but financial troubles persist**  \n",
       "Better purchasing power has led to 5% higher turnover in restaurants and cafés last year, though nearly a quarter of small owners with debts say their financial situation is serious. The sector still battles high debts, fluctuating food costs, and staff shortages, causing more closures than in the past decade.  \n",
       "*Why it matters*: Enjoying your coffee or a night out is fine, but behind the scenes, the hospitality industry remains fragile in the Netherlands.  \n",
       "*What you can do*: Support your local spots but expect occasional closures or price rises due to the difficult operating environment.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Bankruptcies down 15% in 2025**  \n",
       "The number of company bankruptcies decreased by 15% to 3,636 last year, a positive sign post-pandemic and crisis periods. Retail and trade sectors had the highest failures. The rate is far below the peak during the euro crisis and shows slowly improving business resilience.  \n",
       "*Why it matters*: A more stable business climate can be good for job security and economic confidence for expats working or investing here.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Inflation slips slightly to 2.8%, still above eurozone average**  \n",
       "Inflation dropped marginally in December but remains elevated at 2.8%, compared to the eurozone average of 2.1%. Energy costs eased somewhat, but food prices keep inching up by around 3%.  \n",

       "The three largest parties in the October election agreed to govern as a minority cabinet, holding 66 out of 150 parliamentary seats, meaning they’ll need support from other parties on a case-by-case basis. D66's Rob Jetten will be the prime minister. This political setup is rare and promises lots of compromises and potentially shaky governance.  \n",
       "*Why it matters*: Policy changes may be slower and messier; prepare for a political dance that could affect everything from housing regulations to taxes.  \n",

       "**Councils demand Schiphol Airport night flight ban for health reasons**  \n",
       "Fifteen local governments near Schiphol want the airport to shut down flights between 11 pm and 7 am, arguing that nighttime air traffic disrupts sleep and harms residents' health. Schiphol sees 2,400+ night flights annually and has more lenient night flight rules compared to other European hubs.  \n",
       "*Why it matters*: Noise disturbances could get less in some areas if this push succeeds. Less night traffic might also mean changes to your travel plans with fewer late or early flights.  \n",
       "*What you can do*: If you live near Schiphol and hate noise, support local council campaigns or voice your opinion to your municipal council.  \n",
