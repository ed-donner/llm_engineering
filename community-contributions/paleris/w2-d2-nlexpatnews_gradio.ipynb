       "  *Why it matters:* This technology could reduce surgical mistakes and improve outcomes, potentially impacting healthcare quality for expats using Dutch hospitals.  \n",

       "\n",
       "- **Fewer organ transplants last year, but trend still upward**  \n",
       "  In 2025, 1,480 organ transplants occurred, 7% fewer than 2024, but a general long-term increase remains due to policy changes encouraging more organ donations.  \n",
       "  *Why it matters:* Waiting times for transplants like kidneys and hearts are improving, important if you or family members ever find themselves needing such care.  \n",
       "  *What you can do:* Register your choice in the Dutch organ donor register or confirm your status, as default \"no objection\" applies since 2021.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Dutch charity grants 25,000th final wish to terminally ill patients**  \n",
       "  Stichting Ambulance Wens helps terminally ill, immobile patients achieve final wishes, marking a milestone with their 25,000th fulfilled request, with trips accompanied by nurses and volunteers.  \n",
       "  *Why it matters:* Reflects strong community support and care quality for vulnerable people in the Netherlands.  \n",
       "  *What you can do:* If you know someone in need, recommend this charity or volunteer.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **RIVM issues smog warning across Northern Netherlands**  \n",
       "  The National Institute for Public Health issued a smog warning due to rising fine dust levels, with health risks linked to lung function reduction, especially north of the Amsterdam–Arnhem line.  \n",
       "  *Why it matters:* Poor air quality can affect respiratory health, especially for children, elderly, and those with conditions—expats should be aware when spending time outdoors.  \n",

       "- Dutch homeowners claimed a whopping €25 billion in mortgage-related tax deductions in 2024, an increase despite political calls to phase out this generosity.  \n",
       "- The Dutch economy is losing its competitive edge, with concerns raised about monopolies, stifled innovation, and the growing power of big corporations.  \n",
       "- Flower and plant exports reached €7.2 billion in 2025, close to record levels, but new US tariffs threaten this vital sector.  \n",

       "## Economy & Taxes  \n",

       "### Homeowners Deductions Still Costing the Treasury Big Time  \n",
       "Dutch homeowners deducted nearly €25 billion from their taxable income in 2024 through mortgage interest relief and rebates, a 7% rise on 2023. The biggest winners? Families with kids and high earners. Despite decades of criticism and political promises, this tax break remains stubbornly high.  \n",
       "**Why it matters:** If you’re planning on buying a house, this tax relief might influence your calculations — but brace yourself, it’s on the political chopping block, so don’t bank on it forever.  \n",
       "**What you can do:** Keep an eye on government announcements if you’re a homeowner or prospective buyer. Planning your finances without overreliance on this deduction is smart.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### Dutch Economy is Losing Its Mojo  \n",
       "The competition watchdog warns that the Dutch economy has been getting less competitive over the last decade, especially in tech and pharmaceuticals — thanks in part to large companies snapping up potential rivals to kill competition before it even starts (thanks, “killer acquisitions”). This consolidation isn't just bad news for prices; it could stifle innovation and market resilience.  \n",
       "**Why it matters:** Less competition often means higher prices and fewer choices, plus slower tech breakthroughs — all not great if you’re an expat trying to make sense of the local economy and job markets.  \n",
       "**What you can do:** Support small and innovative businesses where you can, and watch out for signs of monopolistic practices in your sectors of interest.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### Flower and Plant Exports Still Blooming, Despite Tariff Storm  \n",
       "Dutch flower exports hit €7.2 billion in 2025, with the US market growing until new tariffs took effect late in the year. Germany and the UK remain key customers, though their demand is shrinking slightly.  \n",
       "**Why it matters:** This is a reminder that global politics and trade policies can hit Dutch staples hard, potentially affecting jobs and prices in the horticulture sector, which is a big employer in parts of the country.  \n",
       "**What you can do:** If you work in or buy from this sector, stay informed about tariff changes and look for alternative markets or suppliers if the US becomes less accessible.  \n",
