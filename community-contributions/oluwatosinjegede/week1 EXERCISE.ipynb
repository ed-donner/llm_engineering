       "- It collects all non-empty author values from a sequence of dicts (books) into a set (which removes duplicates), and then yields each author from that set one by one to the caller.\n",

       "  - This is a set comprehension. It builds a set of all author values (one per book) that pass the filter.\n",
       "  - Using a set automatically deduplicates authors, so duplicates are removed.\n",
       "  - Sets are unordered, so the order of authors in the resulting set is not defined.\n",

       "  - yield from delegates to the iterable (here, the set of authors) and yields each element to the caller.\n",

       "Important nuances and potential improvements\n",
