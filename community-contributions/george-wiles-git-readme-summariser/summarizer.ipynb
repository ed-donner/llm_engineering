The summaries will be guided by system and user prompts.  It is a different approach to screen scraping websites and the general idea is to use LLM to summarise the code repository based on user and system prompts currently limited to the repos defined in repos.txt. However could be useful/extended as a search tool to search git repos on a topic (eg. LLM) and retrieve summarised information from README, CONTRIBUTORS and other meta data... only day 1, so won't get to carried away...\n"
