Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

    "**What you should see:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test 1 (OpenAI)**: Uses Selenium because we forced it. Gets the full rendered content.\n",
    "   - Expected: `‚úì Fetched XXXX characters using Selenium`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test 2 (Your React site)**: Auto-detects minimal content and falls back to Selenium automatically.\n",
    "   - Expected: `‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal content (0 chars) - using Selenium to render JavaScript...`\n",
    "   - Then: `‚úì Fetched XXX characters using Selenium`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test 3 (CNN with enhanced class)**: Uses regular `requests` library for speed since CNN has plenty of static content (>500 chars).\n",
    "   - Expected: `‚úì Fetched 11945 characters using requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test 4 (CNN with original class)**: Should produce the **same result** as Test 3, proving the enhanced class maintains compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key fixes applied:**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ No more duplicate fetching - the `return` statement prevents calling Selenium twice\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Better print messages - clearer status indicators with ‚úì and ‚ö†Ô∏è symbols  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Consistent results - both `Website` and `WebsiteWithSelenium` handle regular sites the same way\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Smart auto-detection - automatically switches to Selenium only when needed (content < 500 chars)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting:** If you see duplicate messages or unexpected behavior:\n",
    "1. **Restart the kernel**: Kernel menu ‚Üí Restart Kernel\n",
    "2. **Re-run from top**: Execute cells from the imports down to the tests\n",
