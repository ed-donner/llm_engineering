# Website Technology Detector

This project scans any website URL and detects the technologies used on that site such as:

- JavaScript libraries  
- CSS frameworks  
- Meta generator tags  
- HTML version  
- Icons (fonts, bootstrap icons, material icons)
- Google Analytics  
- OpenGraph tags  
- CDN links  

It is a simple but useful tool that helps understand what stack a website is built on.
