    "*IDEA* - For visually impaired individuals, daily life often presents numerous obstacles that many of us take for granted. While tools like Braille and guide dogs offer some support, they do not fully address the limitations faced in navigating the world. With over 43.3 million blind people globally, there is a pressing need for more inclusive technologies that help break these barriers. This project aims to do more than assist with daily tasks; it seeks to empower individuals to engage meaningfully with their environment. By providing real-time, contextually accurate captions, this system allows them to experience the world around them, feel less isolated, and regain a sense of autonomy. Beyond just aiding navigation, it provides a bridge to connection—helping them feel more alive, present, and capable. This project is not just about overcoming limitations; it’s about enriching lives and enabling a deeper, fuller interaction with the world, fostering a sense of belonging and independence.\n"
