       "\n",
       "Important detail: the worm is perpendicular to the pages and gnaws from the first page of the first volume to the last page of the second volume. That means the worm starts at the very front of volume 1 (the leftmost page surface) and ends at the very back of volume 2 (the rightmost page surface). The distance between these two pages, along the spine direction, passes through:\n",
       "\n",
       "- the remaining pages of volume 1 from the first page to the end of volume 1,\n",
       "- the back cover of volume 1,\n",
       "- the front cover of volume 2 (since the volumes are side by side, their front/back orientation means the touching faces are the adjacent covers),\n",
       "- and into the pages of volume 2 up to the last page.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, a classic trick is to note that the worm travels through the clear space between the two outer surfaces of the outer covers, i.e., it does NOT need to go through the pages of the volumes if we measure along the external dimension. The actual distance gnawed, when measured along the shelf direction from the first page of volume 1 to the last page of volume 2, is simply the total thickness of the two covers between the two extreme pages, plus zero distance inside the pages that are immediately adjacent to the starting and ending pages. Concretely, the distance is:\n",
       "\n",
       "- thickness of cover of volume 1 that lies to the left of the first page: 0 (the first page is right after the front cover),\n",
       "- thickness of the remaining portion from the first page to the end of volume 1: essentially the rest of volume 1 pages and its back cover,\n",
       "- but the key simplification in this classic problem is that the distance gnawed equals the thickness of the two covers plus the thickness of the two outermost pages blocks that are between the two volumes’ inner faces. In many standard solutions, the result collapses to the sum of the two cover thicknesses, independent of the page thickness, when the worm starts exactly at the first page of volume 1 and ends exactly at the last page of volume 2, because the page blocks cancel out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let’s compute directly with a standard approach:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Each volume: pages thickness = 2 cm.\n",
       "- Each cover thickness = 0.2 cm.\n",
       "- Two volumes placed: [Front cover V1] [Pages V1] [Back cover V1] [Front cover V2] [Pages V2] [Back cover V2].\n",
       "- The worm starts at the first page of V1 (which is immediately after the front cover of V1) and ends at the last page of V2 (which is immediately before the back cover of V2).\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus the distance from start to end includes:\n",
       "- The remainder of V1 from the first page to the end of V1: that is (pages V1 beyond the first page) plus the back cover of V1.\n",
       "- The front cover of V2.\n",
       "- The portion of V2 from its front to the last page: i.e., all of the pages of V2.\n",
       "\n",
       "Summing those gives: (remaining pages of V1) + back cover V1 + front cover V2 + (pages of V2).\n",
       "\n",
       "But remaining pages of V1 = entire pages of V1 minus first page. However, our starting surface is the first page surface, so the worm does not gnaw through the portion of the first page thickness? This is tricky to picture.\n",
       "\n",
       "The well-known elegant answer: the worm gnaws through 4 mm + 2 cm? No.\n",
       "\n",
       "Common puzzle: If books have thickness a and b etc. The result is 0. total? Wait.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another classic: The worm from the first page of the first volume to the last page of the second volume would gnaw through: the front cover of the first volume, the space between the two volumes (which is zero if the covers touch) and the back cover of the second volume? Hmm.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the volumes are placed upright with their spines outward, the distance between first page of V1 and last page of V2 along the shelf equals: front cover of V1 + pages V1 + back cover V1 + front cover V2 + pages V2? But starting at first page avoids front cover of V1 and ending at last page avoids back cover of V2.\n",

       "Thus gnawed distance = (rest of V1) + back cover V1 + front cover V2 + (pages of V2). That equals (pages V1 - 1)*0.1 cm? No pages thickness 2 cm total; first page thickness negligible? Problem expects simple sum: 2 cm + 2 cm + 0.2 cm + 0.2 cm = 4.4 cm? Wait compute:\n",
       "\n",
       "Remaining pages of V1 from first page to end: almost entire 2 cm minus thickness of first page. But page thickness per page not given; we can't subtract. So impossible.\n",

       "I recall a famous puzzle: \"Two volumes: first and second. Each cover 2 mm, pages total 2 cm. A worm gnawed from first page of first volume to last page of second.\" Answer: 4.4 cm?

       "If it goes from first page (which is immediately after front cover) to last page (immediately before back cover), then it gnaws through all pages of both volumes (since start just after front cover in V1 and end just before back cover in V2). So total through pages = 2 cm (V1 pages) + 2 cm (V2 pages) = 4 cm. Additionally, it gnaws through the inner covers between volumes: but between the two volumes, the inner facing surfaces are back cover of V1 and front cover of V2. The worm must pass through those two covers entirely since it goes from inside V1 pages toward between volumes, crossing back cover of V1 (0.2 cm) and then into front cover of V2 (0.2 cm). So add 0.4 cm. Total 4.4 cm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes that seems correct: start at first page (right after front cover). So it does gnaw through the rest of V1 pages (2 cm total pages minus maybe zero because start after first page— but the first page has some thickness; since we start at first page surface, we still must gnaw through the remainder pages thickness of V1 which is essentially the entire 2 cm of pages, except the infinitesimal thickness of the first page? But problem likely assumes continuous page thickness summing to 2 cm; starting at first page means you do gnaw through the rest of V1 pages totaling just under 2 cm, effectively 2 cm). Then add 0.2 cm for back cover of V1, 0.2 cm for front cover of V2, and 2 cm for V2 pages. Sum = 2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 2 = 4.4 cm.\n",

       "   * And goes to the last page of volume 2 (right side)\n",

       "2) When books stand normally on a shelf:\n",
       "   * Volume 1 has its first page on the right side\n",
       "   * Volume 2 has its first page on the left side\n",
       "   * Each book has a front and back cover (2 mm each)\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Converting all measurements to millimeters:\n",
       "   * Pages thickness = 2 cm = 20 mm (per book)\n",
       "   * Each cover = 2 mm\n",
       "\n",
       "4) In Volume 1:\n",
       "   * The worm needs to go through: front cover (2 mm) + all pages (20 mm) = 22 mm\n",
       "\n",
       "5) In Volume 2:\n",
       "   * The worm needs to go through: front cover (2 mm) + all pages (20 mm) = 22 mm\n",
       "\n",
       "6) However, since the books are standing side by side:\n",
       "   * The worm starts at the rightmost side of Volume 1\n",
       "   * To get to the rightmost side of Volume 2\n",
       "   * It only needs to go through: the width of the last cover of Volume 2\n",
