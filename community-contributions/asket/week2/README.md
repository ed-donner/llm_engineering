- **API keys:** set in `.env` at repo root, e.g. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (see day1 for full list).

## Install dependencies

From repo root:

```bash
pip install -r community-contributions/asket/week2/requirements-week2.txt
```

Already run once; re-run if you add or change requirements.
