       "**Abstract**\n",
       "\n",
       "The advent of AI-powered technologies has revolutionized various fields of science and medicine. In this review article, we explore the development, applications, and future directions of an AI-powered, automated, and portable device designed to assess retinal health. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the benefits, limitations, and potential impact of such devices on global healthcare outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Introduction**\n",
       "\n",
       "Retinal diseases are a significant cause of blindness worldwide, with millions of people suffering from conditions like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic methods often involve subjective assessments by clinicians or optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology. Recent advancements in AI-powered technologies have led to the development of innovative devices capable of automated and portable retinal health assessments.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Methods**\n",
       "\n",
       "We conducted a systematic review of existing literature on AI-powered, automated, and portable devices for retinal health assessment. Our search included peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and patents related to the topic. We analyzed the results, highlighting key characteristics, applications, benefits, limitations, and future directions of these devices.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Discussion**\n",
       "\n",
       "The analysis revealed several AI-powered devices capable of detecting various retinal diseases with high accuracy. These devices leverage computer vision algorithms, deep learning techniques, and machine learning models to analyze images obtained through mobile retinoscopes or digital cameras. Key advantages of these devices include portability, affordability, ease of use, and speed.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "\n",
       "The development of AI-powered, automated, and portable devices for retinal health assessment holds significant promise for improving global healthcare outcomes. Future research directions should focus on standardizing evaluation protocols, enhancing device calibration, and exploring clinical trial methodologies to validate these technologies in real-world settings.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Future Directions**\n",
       "\n",
       "We foresee a future where AI-powered, automated, and portable devices become an integral part of primary care services worldwide. Continuous innovation in this field will lead to more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for retinal diseases. Additionally, partnerships between industries, academia, and research institutions are necessary to drive progress in this area.\n",
