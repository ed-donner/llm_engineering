# Prompt Template Configuration

## Overview
Prompt templates are essential for creating consistent and effective prompts in various applications, particularly in natural language processing. This document provides a reference for configuring prompt templates, including their components, best practices, and examples.

## Components of a Prompt Template

### 1. Template Structure
A prompt template typically consists of the following components:
- **Variables**: Placeholders for dynamic content.
- **Static Text**: Fixed text that remains constant across different prompts.
- **Formatting**: Specific instructions for how the text should appear.

### 2. Variable Types
Variables can be categorized into the following types:
- **String Variables**: Represent text inputs.
- **Numeric Variables**: Represent numerical inputs.
- **Boolean Variables**: Represent true/false conditions.

### 3. Contextual Information
Contextual information enhances the relevance of the prompt by providing background or situational context. This can include:
- Previous interactions
- User preferences
- Environmental factors

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Define Variables
Identify and define the variables that will be used in the prompt. Ensure they are descriptive and relevant to the context.

### Step 2: Create the Template
Construct the prompt template using a combination of static text and defined variables. Use the following syntax for variables:
{variable_name}
### Step 3: Implement Formatting
Apply any necessary formatting to the template. This may include:
- Bold text: `**text**`
- Italics: `*text*`
- Line breaks: `\n`

### Step 4: Test the Template
After configuration, test the prompt template with various inputs to ensure it generates the desired output.

## Best Practices

### Clarity
- Use clear and concise language.
- Avoid jargon unless it is well understood by the target audience.

### Consistency
- Maintain consistent variable naming conventions.
- Ensure uniformity in formatting across all templates.

### Flexibility
- Design templates to accommodate a range of inputs.
- Allow for easy updates and modifications.

## Example Prompt Templates

### Example 1: Basic Inquiry
Hello {user_name}, how can I assist you with {issue} today?
### Example 2: Feedback Request
Thank you for using our service, {user_name}. Please rate your experience from 1 to 5 regarding {service_type}.
### Example 3: Conditional Prompt
{is_logged_in ? "Welcome back, {user_name}!" : "Hello! Please log in to continue."}
## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Undefined Variables**: Ensure all variables are defined before use.
- **Formatting Issues**: Double-check formatting syntax for correctness.
- **Contextual Errors**: Verify that contextual information is relevant and updated.
