# Psychological Safety in Teams

**Quick summary (2–4 sentences):**  
> Psychological safety means team members feel safe to speak up, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of ridicule or punishment. It’s a core factor in high-performing teams, according to Google’s Project Aristotle.  

**Nuanced take / caveats:**  
- Not the same as comfort; teams still need accountability.  
- Cultural context affects how safety is perceived.  
- Building it takes consistent leadership behavior.  

**Core concepts:**  
- **Trust:** belief others won’t embarrass or punish.  
- **Learning climate:** openness to mistakes and questions.  
- **Inclusive leadership:** inviting participation from all.  

**Intuitive example / worked demo:**  
> In a psychologically safe team, a junior engineer can point out a bug in the CTO’s design without fear of backlash.  

**When this is useful / limitations:**  
- Useful for innovation, error detection, learning culture.  
- Limitation: too much focus on safety without accountability can lower performance.  

**Concise learning path (4–7 progressive steps):**  
1. Read Amy Edmondson’s *The Fearless Organization*.  
2. Watch Google’s Project Aristotle case study (~1 hr).  
3. Practice open retrospectives with safety check-ins.  
4. Apply small experiments (anonymous feedback, leader vulnerability).  

**Practice exercises (2–4, with difficulty):**  
1. [Easy] Reflect on a time you didn’t speak up in a meeting.  
2. [Medium] Run a “safety check” survey with your team.

**Follow-up prompts (suggestions):**  
- "Give me a 5-minute workshop plan on psychological safety."  
- "Compare with trust and accountability."
