# Bayesian Inference

**Quick summary (2–4 sentences):**  
> Bayesian inference is a method of statistical reasoning that updates the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence is introduced. It’s grounded in Bayes’ theorem, which balances prior beliefs with observed data.

**Nuanced take / caveats:**  
- Requires choosing a prior, which can bias results.  
- Computationally expensive for large models.  
- Often approximated using MCMC or variational methods.  

**Core concepts:**  
- **Prior:** initial belief before seeing data.  
- **Likelihood:** probability of data given hypothesis.  
- **Posterior:** updated belief after evidence.  

**Intuitive example / worked demo:**  
> If you think a coin is fair (50/50), but it lands heads 8 out of 10 times, Bayesian inference lets you update your belief: the coin might be biased towards heads.  

**When this is useful / limitations:**  
- Useful in machine learning, spam filtering, A/B testing.  
- Limitation: can be misleading if priors are poorly chosen.  

**Concise learning path (4–7 progressive steps):**  
1. Learn probability basics (Khan Academy, ~3 hrs).  
2. Study Bayes’ theorem with simple coin/dice examples.  
3. Explore Bayesian stats textbooks (Gelman et al.).  
4. Implement simple models in Python with PyMC (~5 hrs).  

**Practice exercises (2–4, with difficulty):**  
1. [Easy] Compute posterior probability of coin fairness with given priors.  
2. [Medium] Implement a Bayesian spam filter.
