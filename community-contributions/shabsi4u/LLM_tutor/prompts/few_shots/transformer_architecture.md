# Transformer Architecture

**Quick summary (2–4 sentences):**  
> The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in 2017 that revolutionized NLP by replacing recurrence with attention. Its efficiency and scalability enabled large language models like GPT.  

**Nuanced take / caveats:**  
- Scales well but requires huge compute.  
- Attention is quadratic in sequence length (limits context size).  
- Harder to interpret compared to simpler models.  

**Core concepts:**  
- **Self-attention:** lets tokens attend to each other.  
- **Positional encoding:** adds order information.  
- **Encoder/Decoder blocks:** modular structure for translation and beyond.  

**Intuitive example / worked demo:**  
> Imagine reading a sentence: "The cat sat on the mat." Attention lets the model weigh connections like *cat ↔ sat* more strongly than irrelevant words.  

**When this is useful / limitations:**  
- Use-cases: translation, summarization, code generation.  
- Limitations: compute-intensive, less suitable for very long sequences.  

**Concise learning path (4–7 progressive steps):**  
1. Refresh basics of feedforward & RNNs.  
2. Read “Attention is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017).  
3. Study annotated Transformer code (~10 hrs).  
4. Train a mini-Transformer on toy data.  
5. Explore scaling laws & LLMs.  

**Practice exercises (2–4, with difficulty):**  
1. [Easy] Explain self-attention in plain words.  
2. [Medium] Implement scaled dot-product attention in Python.
