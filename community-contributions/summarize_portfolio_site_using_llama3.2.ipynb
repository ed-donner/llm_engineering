    "You'll be able to use this technique for all subsequent projects if you'd prefer not to use paid APIs.\n",

    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "1. No API charges - open-source\n",
    "2. Data doesn't leave your box\n",

    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. Significantly less power than Frontier Model\n",
