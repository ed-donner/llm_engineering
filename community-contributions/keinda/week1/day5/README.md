This project demonstrates a simple AI-powered tutor built using a Large Language Model (LLM).
The tutor provides personalized guidance for newly admitted students based on their profile.

## Student Profile Inputs
- Interests
- Goals
- Academic level
- Constraints (time, language, work hours)
- Preferred learning style

## Output
For each profile category, the tutor generates:

- One relevant learning resource

The goal is to keep guidance practical, beginner-friendly, and easy to follow.

## Notes
