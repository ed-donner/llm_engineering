However, the worm starts at the first page of vol 1 (which is just behind the front cover of vol 1) and ends at the last page of vol 2 (which is just in front of the back cover of vol 2).

Careful: \"first page\" is at the beginning of the pages; from the very first page to the last page of vol 1 would be all 20 mm of pages. But the worm starts at first page, so to reach the back cover of vol 1, it would traverse the rest of pages 20 mm minus some negligible thickness of the first page? Usually these problems ignore page boundaries and take the page thickness as continuous 20 mm. The starting at first page means it needs to traverse the rest of the pages of vol 1: 20 mm of pages.)\n",

But to go from vol 1 to vol 2, it would have to gnaw through the contact between the back cover of vol 1 and the front cover of vol 2. If they are pressed together, the worm would have to gnaw through both covers' inner surfaces?
