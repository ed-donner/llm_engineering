       "- There are two volumes side by side with their covers adjacent in the shelf order: first volume (V1) then second volume (V2).\n",
       "- A worm gnaws straight through the stack from the first page of V1 to the last page of V2, i.e., along a line perpendicular to the pages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key observation:\n",
       "- The worm starts at the very first page of V1 (the outermost page on the left side when looking at the shelf) and ends at the very last page of V2 (the outermost page on the right side).\n",
       "- The gnawed path thus goes through:\n",
       "  - The interior between the two volumes (the air space between V1 and V2) and through the covers/pages of both volumes only if the path passes through them.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the phrase “perpendicular to the pages” and the positions imply the gnawing goes through the thickness along the shelf from the first page of V1 to the last page of V2, i.e., it traverses:\n",
       "- The thickness of the first cover of V1 (on the left outside) is not between the first page and the outer left surface; the worm starts at the first page, so it must go backward through that first page thickness? Wait.\n",
       "\n",
       "Standard solution for this classic puzzle:\n",
       "- Each volume: pages thickness = 2 cm.\n",
       "- Covers: 0.2 cm each.\n",
       "- When volumes stand side by side, the total span from the first page of V1 to the last page of V2 passes through:\n",
       "  - The rest of V1: from first page to the right edge of V1: that includes the entire pages (2 cm) plus the right cover of V1 (0.2 cm), since the first page is the leftmost page, the worm must go through from that page to the rightmost page of V2. It will pass through:\n",
       "    - The remainder of V1: pages after the first page? But the first page is at the leftmost, so to reach the right edge, it goes through the rest of the pages (almost all of 2 cm) plus the right cover of V1 (0.2 cm).\n",
       "  - The space between volumes? There is no air gap; they are adjacent, but the worm can go directly through the interior surfaces between volumes: it must pass through the left cover of V2? Actually from the first page of V1 to the last page of V2, the path goes through:\n",
       "    - The remaining pages of V1 (almost entire 2 cm, but excluding the first page's thickness; however if we assume pages are thin relative to total, the distance through pages is approximately the full 2 cm). The exact common classic result ignores the first page thickness difference and yields total gnawed distance = 2 cm (V1 pages) + 0.2 cm (right cover of V1) + 0.2 cm (left cover of V2) + 2 cm (V2 pages) = 4.4 cm = 44 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hence answer: 4.4 cm (or 44 mm). The reasoning: from the first page of V1 to the last page of V2, the worm passes through the remaining pages of V1 (about 2 cm), the right cover of V1 (0.2 cm), the left cover of V2 (0.2 cm), and the pages of V2 (2 cm). Total 2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 2 = 4.4 cm."
