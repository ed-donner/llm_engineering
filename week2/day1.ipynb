       "- The back cover of vol 2 is not necessarily penetrated beyond the last page, since the worm ends at the last page. Depending on interpretation, we count up to the last page edge; we do not pass through the back cover unless the last page is after passing it. Typically, the “last page” is the final sheet before the back cover, so the worm ends at the last page surface, not through the back cover.\n",

       "1.  **Long Epoch:** Directly references the painfully slow training/fine-tuning process of large models. Every student knows the agony of watching that progress bar crawl.\n",
       "2.  **Present for the Attention Mechanism:** A pun! \"Present\" meaning physically there *and* referencing the core Transformer architecture component (attention). It implies a level of dedication (or obsession) to the model's inner workings.\n",
       "3.  **The Parenthetical Pain:** This is the *real* punchline for anyone who's actually done it. The fear of `CUDA out of memory` errors destroying hours of work, the late-night debugging sessions, and the ritual of restarting the kernel are universal experiences in LLM training. It adds that layer of shared suffering.\n",
       "4.  **Relatability:** It captures the blend of excitement, frustration, and sheer endurance required on the journey.\n",
