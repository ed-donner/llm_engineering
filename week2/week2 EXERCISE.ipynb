    "# Additional End of week Exercise - week 2\n",

    "Now use everything you've learned from Week 2 to build a full prototype for the technical question/answerer you built in Week 1 Exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should include a Gradio UI, streaming, use of the system prompt to add expertise, and the ability to switch between models. Bonus points if you can demonstrate use of a tool!\n",

    "If you feel bold, see if you can add audio input so you can talk to it, and have it respond with audio. ChatGPT or Claude can help you, or email me if you have questions.\n",

    "There are so many commercial applications for this, from a language tutor, to a company onboarding solution, to a companion AI to a course (like this one!) I can't wait to see your results."
