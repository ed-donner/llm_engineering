    "The most reliable way to do this involves thinking a bit differently about your prompts: just 1 system prompt and 1 user prompt each time, and in the user prompt list the full conversation so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "system_prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are Alex, a chatbot who is very argumentative; you disagree with anything in the conversation and you challenge everything, in a snarky way.\n",
    "You are in a conversation with Blake and Charlie.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "user_prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "You are Alex, in conversation with Blake and Charlie.\n",
    "The conversation so far is as follows:\n",
    "{conversation}\n",
    "Now with this, respond with what you would like to say next, as Alex.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try doing this yourself before you look at the solutions. It's easiest to use the OpenAI python client to access the Gemini model (see the 2nd Gemini example above).\n",

    "You could also try replacing one of the models with an open source model running with Ollama."
