and displayed in a table, providing a mirror of their stated values and how they've changed over time.

Features:
- Input a topic and your personal position.
- The chatbot responds and logs the conversation.
- Maintains a table tracking your beliefs by topic, stance, and last updated time.

Libraries to install:
- `gradio`
- `ddgs`

To install the required libraries, run:

How to Use:
1. Run all cells in the notebook.
2. Enter a topic and your position in the gradio interface.
