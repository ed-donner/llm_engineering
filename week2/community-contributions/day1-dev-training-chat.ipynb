Every employee record goes into the same type of folder, with the exact same sections - name, department, salary, start date. Everything is structured identically. If you need to find all employees in Engineering who started after 2020, you can quickly flip through because you know exactly where to look in each folder.\n",

       "**NoSQL databases** are more like a flexible storage room where you can store different types of containers. Some employees might have video portfolios, others have stacks of certifications, some have simple index cards. You have more freedom in what you store and how, but finding specific patterns across all employees might require checking each container differently.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's what really matters for your architecture decisions:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **SQL shines when** your data has clear relationships (like employees belong to departments, departments have budgets) and you need ACID guarantees - think financial transactions where consistency is critical.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **NoSQL excels when** you're dealing with varied data structures, need horizontal scaling across multiple servers easily, or when you're prioritizing speed over perfect consistency.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most importantly: neither is \"better\" - they're tools for different jobs. I've seen too many projects fail because someone picked MongoDB just because it was \"modern\" when they really needed PostgreSQL's relational integrity.\n",
       "\n",

Plus, I remember reading somewhere that NoSQL can legit scale better with tons of users because it uses horizontal scaling.\n",

And you're absolutely right about the horizontal scaling - NoSQL databases can spread across servers like butter on warm toast.\n",

       "- **Cassandra** (NoSQL) stores the actual posts and timeline data. Why? Because they need to handle billions of posts across global data centers, and each post might have different metadata.\n",
