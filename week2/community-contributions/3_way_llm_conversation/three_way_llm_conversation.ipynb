    "# Three-Way LLM Conversation (OpenAI · Anthropic · Gemini)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a reliable pattern for orchestrating a **three-way conversation between different Large Language Models (LLMs)**—specifically OpenAI (GPT), Anthropic (Claude), and Google Gemini—using **one system prompt and one user prompt per turn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Being Solved\n",
    "Most LLM APIs are stateless. To simulate a multi-agent conversation, each model must be shown the **entire conversation history** every time it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to:\n",
    "- Keep **distinct personalities** per model\n",
    "- Maintain **conversation continuity**\n",
    "- Avoid complex role juggling (`assistant`, `user`, etc.)\n",
    "- Remain compatible across providers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "This notebook uses a **round-robin orchestration pattern**:\n",
    "1. Each model has a **fixed system prompt** defining its persona\n",
    "2. The **entire conversation so far** is passed as a single user message\n",
    "3. The model is instructed to generate **only its next line**\n",
    "4. The response is appended to the shared transcript\n",
    "5. The process repeats for the next model\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is simple, robust, and works consistently across providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "The models are personified as three stand-up comedians performing together:\n",
    "- **Oliver (GPT)** — deadpan, analytical\n",
    "- **Andrew (Claude)** — practical, crowd-working\n",
    "- **George (Gemini)** — absurd, chaotic\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario is illustrative; the same pattern applies to:\n",
    "- Multi-agent planning\n",
    "- Debate systems\n",
    "- Role-based assistants\n",
    "- Cross-model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Design Principles\n",
    "- One system prompt per model\n",
    "- One user prompt per call\n",
    "- Full transcript passed every turn\n",
    "- Explicit speaker labels in the transcript\n",
    "- Strict instruction to generate a single response\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- API keys for:\n",
    "  - OpenAI\n",
    "  - Anthropic\n",
    "  - Google Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment variables:\n",
    "- `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n",
    "- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n",
    "- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- The OpenAI SDK is used with alternative `base_url` values for Anthropic and Gemini via their OpenAI-compatible endpoints.\n"
