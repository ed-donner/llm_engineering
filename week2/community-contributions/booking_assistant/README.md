## Booking Assistant – Week 2 Extension

This project extends the Week 2 exercises of the **Ed Donner LLM Engineering course** by building a small booking assistant prototype.

It demonstrates:
- Gradio chat UI  
- System prompt for domain expertise  
- OpenAI Chat Completions API  
- Tool calling with a real hotel search API (**Booking.com via RapidAPI**)  
- Multi-step tool execution loop  
- Model switching  

The assistant finds hotels based on **city and date range** and integrates external tool results back into the conversation.
