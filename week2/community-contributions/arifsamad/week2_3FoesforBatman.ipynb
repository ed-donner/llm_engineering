Annoying, maybe, but ultimately forgettable. Batman needs a challenge! He needs someone who truly understands the *art* of chaos, the *poetry* of madness.\\n\\nYou give him riddles? Cute. I give him existential crises. You think a tricky question is going to keep him up at night? Ha! I\\'m the reason he sleeps with his utility belt on. I\\'m the reason he has that little twitch in his eye when he hears a hyena laugh. I\\'m the *reason* he actually *tries*.\\n\\nYou\\'re just a little hobby, a mental exercise. I\\'m the main event, the grand finale, the reason he puts on the cape in the first place! Without me, he\\'s just some rich dude in pajamas playing dress-up. He *needs* me. He craves me. He secretly *loves* our little dance.\\n\\nSo, take your alphabet soup and your overly complicated traps and go play in the kiddie pool. The grown-ups are talking. And by \"grown-ups,\" I mean Batman and his favorite, most *delightful* nemesis. Now, tell me, what\\'s green and tells jokes that aren\\'t funny? A Riddler who thinks he\\'s the Joker! *Heh heh heh!*'"

My clever riddles and complex crimes tested his mettle time and again. While your chaotic nature may have kept him occupied, I showed him the true meaning of intellectual combat.\\n\\nBatman's respect and admiration aren't born from simplistic anarchy or a lack of sophistication, but from the thrill of the challenge and the triumph of outsmarting his foe. And that, my friend, is where I – the Riddler – hold the greatest advantage over... (dramatic pause) ...your illustrious self!\""
