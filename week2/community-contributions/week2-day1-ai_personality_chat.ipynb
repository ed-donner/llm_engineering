    "## **Key Improvements Over Original Script**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Source of Truth**  \n",
    "   - Original: Two separate message lists (`gpt_messages`/`claude_messages`)  \n",
    "   - New: **One unified conversation history** tracking both speakers  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Eliminates synchronization bugs, easier debugging  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proper API Security**  \n",
    "   - Original: No key management shown  \n",
    "   - New: **Environment variables + validation**  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Teaches secure API key handling best practices  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Personality Configuration**  \n",
    "   - Original: Hardcoded system prompts  \n",
    "   - New: **Config objects** with names/system prompts/models  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Clear separation of concerns, easy to modify personalities  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**  \n",
    "   - Original: No error handling  \n",
    "   - New: **Try/catch blocks** around API calls  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Prevents crashes during teaching demonstrations  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Role Management**  \n",
    "   - Original: Manual role assignment  \n",
    "   - New: **Automatic role formatting** via `format_conversation_history()`  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Demonstrates proper LLM API message structuring  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Teaching-Friendly Features**  \n",
    "   - Type hints (`List[Dict]`)  \n",
    "   - Detailed docstrings  \n",
    "   - Progress printouts  \n",
    "   - Simulated debate starter  \n",
    "   - Configurable turn limit  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Real-World Relevance**  \n",
    "   - Original: Mixed Claude/GPT models  \n",
    "   - New: **Pure GPT implementation**  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Students learn to manage multiple personalities *within one model type*  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Scalability**  \n",
    "   - Original: Fixed 5-turn loop  \n",
    "   - New: **Parameterized turns** (`max_turns=3`)  \n",
    "   - Benefit: Easy to extend for longer conversations  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why This Matters for Students**  \n",
    "This version demonstrates:  \n",
    "- Professional-grade API integration  \n",
    "- System prompt engineering  \n",
    "- Conversation state management  \n",
    "- Security practices (no keys in code)  \n",
    "- Config-driven development  \n",
    "\n",
    "The original script was a minimal proof-of-concept, while this version shows **production-ready patterns** students will encounter in real AI applications.\n",
