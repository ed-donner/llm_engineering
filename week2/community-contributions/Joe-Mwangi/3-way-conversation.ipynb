    "# 3-MODEL CONVERSATION ATTEMPT\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    " Instead of switching between assistant and user roles, pass the entire previous conversation as the user prompt for the next \"conversant\" \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasoning\n",
    " Say we use the \"user\" and \"assistant\" roles for the 3-model convesation, then:\n",
    " - Model1 begins the conversation\n",
    " - Model1's reply becomes the user prompt for Model2\n",
    " - Model2's reply becomes the user prompt for Model3\n",
    " - If we pass Model1's response as its assistant prompt, and model3's response as its user prompt, then we shall have ommitted model2's response.\n",
    "\n",
    " Thus the reason for passing the entire converstation is to maintain the context without ommision."
