When I went to gate 5 - no body was at that gate which depress me a lot because it was already a bording time pass. Later I checked on the departure screen for my flight - it was gate #1, so I had to go back again upstairs in hurry as the boarding time already pass. They never anounced or telling customer anything at the original boarding gate - WHICH WAS TOTALY STUPID.

Makes you wonder how Vistara plans to promote web check-in if passengers end up in line anyway.\n",
      "Flight was delayed more than 18 hours, checked in bag damaged, no accountability from vistara ground staff. Worst experience. Shall compensate all the charges with double Ticket refund\n",
      "The flight was an hour late. There were no gate announcements or displays. After getting on the plane, there was a further delay without any explanation.\n",
      "The flight was on time. I upgraded to Premium Economy and it was comfortable. The food was very good. Staff were courteous.\n",
      "Flight was delayed but no announcements were made. Till the boarding it was still showing original schedule time at the monitor and also on your mobile app. It left the gate half hour later than scheduled.\n",
      "It’s really very nice experience with very nice behaviour respected crews n all Vistara members thankyou so much Vistara to give us humble hospitality\n",
      "My wife with 5 month son were traveling. No proper support was provided for luggage handling. Although it was requested in prior. My wife sole manage everything and was not as expected.\n",
      "This was an old 320 without a screen or USB charging port even in the business class. The food could have been better.\n",
      "a real good flying experince. Everything was excellent right from check-in to baggage collection at destination.\n",
      "IndiGo is low cost and therefore no frills, but is always a pleasant experience. No mood lighting and fancy features but clean aircraft, professional crew and absolute value for money.\n",
      "Very hard seats. No food service, even though price is not competitive.\n",
      "Very hard seats for long flights. No food even on International flight. Won't fly Indigo again if I can help it.\n",
      "Terrible experience at IST airport due to mismanagement by ground and wheelchair staff.\n",
      "Some seats don’t recline. No USB port or power outlet, no inflight WIFI - not even for SMS/Messaging apps. Ontime performance was very good. They should have at least one crew member who speaks the local language, for flights like these.\n",
      "Although we took the XL seats with more width, we found that you do not have a seat in front to stow your personal item, nor can you stretch your legs. This is not the best option for a comfortable seat. Boarding was timely but disorganized without any row based entry.\n",
      "Not professional and didn’t know about double seat even when I paid for it and have a confirmation. Lack of comms between teams.\n",
      "deboarding is very poor after landing it took around 45 minutes to come out.\n",
      "My baggage bag got broken and only 3000 voucher was given for compensation\n",
      "Crew members forgot to serve sandwiches after serving the coffee. Worst was the handling of bag. One of wheel was Broken making it useless. Though a complaint was registered and assured of compensation voucher equal to part cost of the new bag.\n",
      "Poor customer service! They don’t have 24/7 customer service. I was stranded in the transit area of the airport for over 21 hours. I was denied to board a plane without any help that caused my entire return flight to be cancelled. I had to book an entire new return flights. It caused me lots of stress, waste of my time and money.\n",
      "What started as a small delay at checkin ended up being a two and a half hour delay by the time the plane took off. The annoying part was that we weren’t told what the holdup was.\n",
      "Offer a pillow in business class for night flight. More comfortable seats. Offer alcoholic beverages. Get flight attendants that care.\n",
      "It was not possible to do an online checkin with Nepal Airlines. Apart from that, all the rest was very good : good food, friendly staff that ensure that Covid rules are respected (not always easy),…\n",
      "Overall it was good. But air planes should be upgraded.\n",
      "very run down aircraft. seat tilted. the mobile / magazine holder was broken. The entertainment screen was not working. The crew was good, polite and helpful\n",
      "Food is good, staff is good... Wi-fi quality is poor, disembarkment after landing is atrocious.\n",
      "Flight crew was lovely. Bathrooms should have been cleaner. The handsets in business class for watching the entertainment are horrible. Very difficult to figure out which buttons are for what. I managed to get the flight maps on my screen but it wasn't easy. Never got anything else up.\n",
      "Inflight Services are poor compared to other airlines. They do not offer even water during 15 hr flight. Food is little in portion and I had food poisoning after last meal ( rajma chawal)\n",
      "This was a bery good experience as it was a newer plane . AI older plane bussiness class is bad .\n",
      "I had a camera bag that exceeded the 10kg allowance for hand luggage. I am 67 years old and have been travelling will my cameras and lenses all over the world and have not paid once for the excess weight. Also, even if I wanted to check in the bag, I can’t due to lithium batteries and delicate equipment. Air India should review their policies. Or is it just a cash grab. I had to pay additional 7000 rupees.\n",
      "Other than the inflight video screen freezing for about four hours everything else was brilliant.\n",
      "The aircraft interiors are falling apart. Felt like a waste paying for business class as it was indistinguishable from economy in any way.\n",
      "What a pathetic plane it was. Entertainment system didn’t work. USB port was broken. There was a hole on top of folding serving table. Broken restrooms in the middle of flight.\n",

      "Air India is the national flag carrier of India and has been providing air services since October 15th, 1932. Initially its name was Tata Airlines but later it was changed to Air India. It is India’s first international airline that offers a distinctive look with a red colored flying swan. It provides luxurious air services to international passengers at economical costs and discounted fares.   Air India offers many international flights but the US is the most important international destination and a large number of passengers travel between India and the United States on a daily basis.   Air India had the honour of being the first airline to start commercial operations from the recently opened Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport at Durgapur with a flight connecting Kolkata to Durgapur and back. The inaugural flight was operated by Alliance Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India.\n",
