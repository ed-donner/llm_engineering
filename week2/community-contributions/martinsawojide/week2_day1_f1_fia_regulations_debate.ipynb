        "This notebook extends the adversarial chatbot conversation from `day1.ipynb` into a **3-way debate** between Formula 1 entities arguing about FIA Technical Regulations and suspected foul play in car design.\n",

        "**Setting:** The 2024/2025 F1 season, before the major 2026 regulation overhaul.\n",

        "**Scenario:** Red Bull Racing has filed a formal protest with the FIA, alleging that McLaren's car features an aerodynamic device that violates the current FIA Technical Regulations. The FIA must mediate the dispute while both teams argue their case. 5 rounds of heated debate ensue."
