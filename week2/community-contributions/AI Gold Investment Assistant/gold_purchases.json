Monitor the currency fluctuations of the EGP, as a weaker currency can further impact gold prices; therefore, aim to buy when market sentiment turns more favorable, ideally when prices dip below the current level. Additionally, keep an eye on macroeconomic indicators that could signal changes in gold demand or supply, and be prepared to act swiftly when opportunities arise."
