    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an AI-powered assistant for the classic code-breaking game **Mastermind**. I have worked across frontend frameworks (react, angular), backend API centric applications (Java SpringBoot, Node) and everything in between, and am interested in how quickly this can be achieved with the gradio UX, incorporating LLM for game logic next moves... etc.. and can include concepts covered including **tool use**, **function calling**, **multi-modal interactions**, and **stateful conversation management**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mastermind is a code-breaking logic game where:\n",
    "- The computer creates a secret code of coloured pegs (typically 4 colors chosen from 6-8 options)\n",
    "- The player makes guesses to crack the code\n",
    "  - duplicate colours are allowed\n",
    "  - llm provides next move analysis with text to speech for summary\n",
    "- After each guess, feedback is provided:\n",
    "  - **Black pegs**: Correct colour in the correct position\n",
    "  - **White pegs**: Correct colour in the wrong position\n",
    "- The goal is to crack the code in the fewest guesses possible (usually 10-12 attempts)\n",

Let's clarify the reasoning behind the recommendation based on the feedback from Guess #2.\\n\\n### Understanding the Feedback from Guess #2\\n\\n**Guess #2:** [Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange]\\n- **Feedback:** 1 black peg, 3 white pegs\\n- **Interpretation:**\\n  - **1 Black Peg:** This indicates that one of the colors is in the correct position.\\n  - **3 White Pegs:** This indicates that three colors are correct but in the wrong positions. \\n\\n### Analyzing the Colors from Guess #2\\n\\nFrom Guess #2, we have the following deductions:\\n- Since there are three colors that are correct but in the wrong position, we can conclude that Blue, Green, and Orange are indeed part of the code. Given that Yellow was part of this guess and based on Guess #1 feedback (where it received 0 black pegs), we can confirm that Yellow is not part of the secret code.\\n\\n### Why Introduce a New Color?\\n\\nThe recommendation to introduce a new color arises from the need to determine the correct positions of Blue, Green, and Orange:\\n- **Identifying Correct Positions:** While we know that Blue, Green, and Orange are in the code, we need to figure out their exact positions. By trying different combinations of these confirmed colors along with a new color (like Red), we can ascertain which of the three colors might be in the correct position and eliminate the uncertainty regarding their placements.\\n\\n### Final Justification\\n\\nThe rationale behind suggesting a new guess with a new color (like Red) is to optimize the guessing process:\\n- **Avoiding Repetition:** If we keep guessing the same three colors in different orders without testing a new color, we may waste guesses on combinations that do not help us isolate the correct positions effectively.\\n- **Efficient Use of Guesses:** By introducing Red, we can gather more information about whether it's part of the code or not, while still testing the known colors (Blue, Green, Orange) in potentially new positions.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nSo, while we know that Blue, Green, and Orange are correct, we need to determine their positions and validate that there isn't another color (like Red) that could also be in the code. \\n\\n### Final Recommendation\\n\\n**Continue to investigate the confirmed colors (Blue, Green, Orange) but also incorporate a new color (like Red) in your next guess to efficiently narrow down the positions.** For example, a guess like [Blue, Green, Orange, Red] can help achieve this goal.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Here is the last feedback given about a Mastermind guess:\\n🔍 **AI ANALYSIS** (via <openai.OpenAI object at 0x11b0c3800>)\\n\\n**Your Proposed Guess:** Green → Orange → Yellow → Blue\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet's analyze the current game state based on the provided guess history and the proposed guess of [Green, Orange, Yellow, Blue].\\n\\n### Guess History Breakdown\\n\\n1. **Guess #1: [Red, Blue, Green, Yellow]**\\n   - **Feedback:** 0 black pegs, 3 white pegs\\n   - **Interpretation:** \\n     - None of the colors are in the correct position.\\n     - Three colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) are in the code but in different positions.
