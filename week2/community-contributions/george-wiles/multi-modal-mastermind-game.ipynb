    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an AI-powered assistant for the classic code-breaking game **Mastermind**. I have worked across frontend frameworks (react, angular), backend API centric applications (Java SpringBoot, Node) and everything in between, and am interested in how quickly this can be achieved with the gradio UX, incorporating LLM for game logic next moves... etc.. and can include concepts covered including **tool use**, **function calling**, **multi-modal interactions**, and **stateful conversation management**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mastermind is a code-breaking logic game where:\n",
    "- The computer creates a secret code of coloured pegs (typically 4 colors chosen from 6-8 options)\n",
    "- The player makes guesses to crack the code\n",
    "  - duplicate colours are allowed\n",
    "  - llm provides next move analysis with text to speech for summary\n",
    "- After each guess, feedback is provided:\n",
    "  - **Black pegs**: Correct colour in the correct position\n",
    "  - **White pegs**: Correct colour in the wrong position\n",
    "- The goal is to crack the code in the fewest guesses possible (usually 10-12 attempts)\n",

Understand the rules. \\n** MASTERMIND GAME RULES are as follows: **\\n- The computer creates a secret code of four pegs, each chosen from six possible colors: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple.\\n- Duplicates are allowed (the same color may appear multiple times in the code).\\n- The player makes guesses to crack the code.\\n- After each guess:\\n    - a COUNT of Black pegs are given for each peg that's the correct color and in the correct position.\\n    - a COUNT of White pegs are given for each correct color that is in the wrong position.\\n    - Number of black and white pegs does NOT reveal the positions.\\n- The goal is to guess the code in as few attempts as possible.\\n\\n2. When a user a question to challenge your move analysis about a previous Mastermind guessExplain or justify the feedback according to Mastermind rules in the context of the users challenge.Be concise but thorough. Always end with a clear recommendation.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Previous analysis: 🔍 **AI ANALYSIS** (via <openai.OpenAI object at 0x123ead760>)\\n\\n**Your Proposed Guess:** Yellow → Orange → Blue → Yellow\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Analysis of the Current Game State\\n\\n**Guess History Breakdown:**\\n1. **Guess #1: [Purple, Orange, Red, Blue]**\\n   - Feedback: 1 black peg, 1 white peg\\n   - Interpretation: One color is correct and in the right position (black), and one is correct but in the wrong position (white).\\n\\n2. **Guess #2: [Purple, Orange, Red, Blue]**\\n   - Feedback: Identical to Guess #1.\\n   - Interpretation: This reinforces the previous guess since it’s the same colors. The same black and white peg counts suggest the same colors are in play.\\n\\n3. **Guess #3: [Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow]**\\n   - Feedback: 2 black pegs, 0 white pegs\\n   - Interpretation: Two yellows are correct and in the right position. This implies that two pegs in the secret code are Yellow, and Yellow cannot be in any of the other two positions.\\n\\n4. **Guess #4: [Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Purple]**\\n   - Feedback: 2 black pegs, 1 white peg\\n   - Interpretation: Confirms that Yellow is indeed a part of the code (two positions).

Therefore, the proposed guess maintains this logic effectively.\\n\\n2. **Testing Orange and Blue:**\\n   - Since Orange has been present in previous guesses with favorable feedback, keeping it in the guess is strategic. The introduction of Blue will help determine if it is part of the code. \\n\\n3. **Consider the Feedback:**\\n   - If this guess yields higher black peg counts, it will help zero in on the positions of the Yellow pegs. If it yields low counts, it may indicate the need to reassess the potential colors.\\n\\n### Recommendation\\nProceed with the proposed guess of **[Yellow, Orange, Blue, Yellow]**. This maintains known colors while testing new combinations, allowing for further deduction based on feedback.
