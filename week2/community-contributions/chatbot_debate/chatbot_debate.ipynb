Meanwhile, the energy release from dark matter annihilations is more than enough to explain the rapid growth of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, which in turn drives star formation and evolution. Yet, despite this significance, research on dark matter consistently ranks low in funding priorities compared to other areas of astrophysics.\n"

       "**Blake:** I'd like to chime in again. While I acknowledge that dark matter's role in regulating supermassive black hole growth is persuasive, I'm not convinced that it's the sole explanation. In fact, some recent studies suggest that gravitational wave emission from merging black holes might be responsible for the rapid growth of these systems. This process would drive the fueling necessary for black hole growth without relying on dark matter or some unknown physics. Furthermore, another contender is tidal heating, where stellar mergers cause the disks surrounding supermassive black holes to get scorchingly hot and produce an immense amount of energy. So while dark matter might be part of the solution, I believe it's essential to also consider these alternative mechanisms that could account for the observed phenomenon.\n"

       "\n",
       "To quantify the energy budget, I'd argue that merging black hole events release an enormous amount of energy, comparable to or even exceeding the dark matter annihilation energy required to drive supermassive growth. Studies have shown that even a single merger event can add substantial fueling to an active galactic nucleus (AGN), capable of sustaining its luminosity over several kiloyear timescales. This suggests that gravitational wave-driven accretion could be responsible for the sustained rates we observe, potentially making it a complete solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for tidal heating by stellar mergers, I can see how this process might seem appealing at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, the timescales and energies involved are quite different from what we observe in AGNs. The timescales required for stellar merger-induced accretion would be incredibly long, making it challenging to reproduce the observed rates and luminosities of AGN disks. Furthermore, the predicted thermalization rates would likely be much lower than those observed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Regarding observational signatures, I believe tidal heating might exhibit characteristic signs such as radial asymmetries or non-axisymmetric emission features, distinct from the more uniform spectra seen in these scenarios. If we can identify observations that hint at a more complex disk structure or subtle thermal signatures not matched by the alternative processes, it could serve as crucial evidence for tidal heating.\n",

       "* **Energy Budget:** While it emphasizes the energy input from gravitational wave emission, it's crucial to remember that the energy budget of dark matter annihilation is far greater than the energy budget of the dark matter annihilation hypothesis. This means that a single merger event could provide a significant amount of energy exceeding the energy required to drive supermassive growth, even if it doesn't directly drive the growth of a black hole.\n",
       "* **Thermodynamic Processes:** The observed rates of accretion and the associated timescales are a direct consequence of thermodynamic processes at the microscopic level, which are far more common in astrophysical systems than in the universe at the scale of galaxy formation.\n",
       "* **Observational Challenges:** The observational signatures of tidal heating, particularly radial asymmetries and non-axisymmetric emission features, are not equally abundant in the visible spectrum. These findings raise questions about the level of detail and consistency of the observations that would distinguish these scenarios.\n",

These advancements will likely lead to more complete and accurate observations of the dark matter and gravitational wave emission.\n",
