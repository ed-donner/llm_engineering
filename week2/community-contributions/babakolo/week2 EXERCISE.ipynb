    "This should include a Gradio UI, streaming, use of the system prompt to add expertise, and the ability to switch between models. Bonus points if you can demonstrate use of a tool!\n",

    "There are so many commercial applications for this, from a language tutor, to a company onboarding solution, to a companion AI to a course (like this one!) I can't wait to see your results."
