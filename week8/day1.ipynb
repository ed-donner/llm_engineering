    "\n",
    "> In case anyone else using Windows hits this problem: Along with having to run `modal token new` from a command prompt, you have to move the generated token file. It will deploy the token file (.modal.toml) to your Windows profile folder. The virtual environment couldn't see that location (strangely, it couldn't even after I set environment variables for it and rebooted). I moved that token file to the folder I'm operating out of for the lab and it stopped throwing auth errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Doing in the manual way:\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be totally fine to simply add the 2 keys directly to your .env file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MODAL_TOKEN_ID=ak-...\n",
    "MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET=as-...\n",
    "```\n",
