    "## Understanding Multiple LLM Calls Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **chained LLM calls pattern** - one of the most common Agentic AI patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Flow:\n",
    "1. **First LLM Call** (`select_relevant_links`): Uses an LLM to intelligently filter and select relevant links from a website\n",
    "2. **Data Gathering** (`fetch_page_and_all_relevant_links`): Fetches content from the selected links (no LLM needed)\n",
    "3. **Second LLM Call** (`create_brochure` or `stream_brochure`): Uses another LLM call to synthesize all the gathered information into a brochure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multiple Calls?\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each LLM call has a specific, focused task\n",
    "- **Better Results**: Specialized prompts for each task yield better outcomes\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency**: Can use smaller/faster models for simpler tasks (like link selection)\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Easy to modify or improve individual steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "LLM Call 1 → Process Results → Gather Data → LLM Call 2 → Final Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a foundational pattern you'll see throughout Agentic AI systems!\n"
