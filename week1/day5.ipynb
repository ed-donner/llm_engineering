       "## Who Are We?  \n",
       "Welcome to IBM X-Force Red — the *Sherlock Holmes* of cybersecurity, but with more tech gadgets and less deerstalker hats. We’re IBM’s elite penetration testing team, skilled in the fine art of “hacking” your own systems **before** the bad guys do. With decades of experience—and possibly some nerves of steel—we dive into your applications, AI models, cloud platforms, hardware, and even people (yep, social engineering too) to sniff out vulnerabilities lurking in the shadows.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Our Superpowers\n",
       "\n",
       "- 🔍 **AI Testing:** We test your cutting-edge Foundation Models, Large Language Models, AI pipelines, and GenAI applications to ensure no sinister loophole escapes. Because Tyrion Lannister said it best, \"A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone,\" and yours needs protection.\n",
       "\n",
       "- 🛠️ **Application Testing:** Web, mobile, thick clients, APIs—if it talks to the internet, we’ll break it, fix it, and report back. Includes manual penetration testing, secure code review, and binary analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "- ☁️ **Cloud Security Testing:** Hunting misconfigurations and insecure DevOps secrets like exposed API keys or object storage blunders. Because cloud leaks are so last decade.\n",
       "\n",
       "- 🌐 **External Network Testing:** Our hackers think like the enemy to uncover paths that lead to unauthorized access. We attack your network so the real attackers can’t.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Why Us?  \n",
       "\n",
       "We’re not just penetration testers; we’re the friendly neighborhood adversaries working for you. Using the same tools, tactics, and mindset as cybercriminals, we uncover the most dangerous gaps before malicious actors do—because prevention beats the headache of a data breach every time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Plus, we’re backed by IBM's legendary resources and research, including the **X-Force Threat Intelligence Index** and the **Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024**—think of it as our hacker’s diary, full of valuable insights.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Who Loves Us?\n",
       "\n",
       "- From **Fortune 500 giants** to innovators pushing AI boundaries, companies trust us to protect their digital crown jewels.  \n",
       "- Sports legends like UFC and Scuderia Ferrari love IBM’s AI magic, and though X-Force Red works behind the scenes, we power the speed, security, and thrills you enjoy.\n",

       "---\n",

       "## Our Culture: Hacker Zest Meets IBM Best\n",
       "\n",
       "- A no-nonsense environment where curiosity *and* coffee flow in equal measure.  \n",
       "- Diverse teams of cybersecurity pros who love a good challenge—ethical hacking, thoughtful research, and geeky banter encouraged.  \n",
       "- Continuous learning is a way of life, especially because technology (and hackers) evolve faster than your favorite streaming service updates.  \n",
       "- Collaboration, integrity, and a shared mission to outsmart cybercrime with wit, skill, and a sprinkle of hacker humor.\n",

       "## Careers: Ready to Join the Good Side?\n",
       "\n",
       "If you’re a penetration tester, bug bounty hunter, AI security enthusiast, or just someone who thinks “Ctrl+Alt+Del” is part of a magical ritual, come join the X-Force Red ranks! Here you’ll:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Work with bleeding-edge tech like AI and cloud security.  \n",
       "- Hack with purpose—protecting organizations worldwide.  \n",
       "- Collaborate with world-class experts (and occasionally prank each other with terminal commands).  \n",
       "- Access IBM’s trove of knowledge, tools, and career development resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pro Tip:** Your skills might get tested—literally. But rest assured, you’ll be joining a community that celebrates the hacker spirit with the ethics of a superhero.\n",
