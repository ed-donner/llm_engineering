It introduced iconic characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, and Princess Leia, and set a standard for the sci-fi genre.\n",

       "2. **Prequel Trilogy (PT)**: Released between 1999 and 2005, this trilogy includes \"The Phantom Menace,\" \"Attack of the Clones,\" and \"Revenge of the Sith.\" While it expanded the lore of the Jedi and Sith, it received mixed reviews primarily due to dialogue and pacing, yet it has developed a dedicated fan base over time.\n",

       "3. **Sequel Trilogy (ST)**: Featuring \"The Force Awakens\" (2015), \"The Last Jedi\" (2017), and \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019), this trilogy sought to introduce new characters while paying homage to the originals. Its reception has been polarized, with strong opinions on character development and narrative coherence.\n",
