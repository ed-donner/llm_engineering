Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What problem does it solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning by rewarding correct answers, but performance typically saturates after a few thousand training steps - models stop improving because they explore too little. Attempts to continue training produce diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "BroRL proposes scaling exploration by dramatically increasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds. Instead of merely increasing training steps, BroRL keeps the same number of gradient updates but broadens the search space by sampling many more trajectories. A simple theoretical analysis shows that in a one‑step RL setting, each rollout contributes positive probability mass to correct actions, while the influence of unsampled actions vanishes as rollouts increase. BroRL therefore guarantees overall improvement when the number of samples grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretical guarantee: A mass‑balance argument proves that sampling more rollouts monotonically expands the correct probability mass and shrinks the impact of unseen actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviving saturated models: BroRL revives models that plateaued after ~3K ProRL steps, achieving continued performance gains when ProRL had saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "State-of-the-art results: For a 1.5B‑parameter model, BroRL achieves state‑of‑the‑art performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that exploration scaling can be more effective than extending training steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could combine BroRL with structured search methods (e.g., MCTS) or budget allocation schemes (see Knapsack RL) to further optimize exploration. BroRL might also be extended beyond one‑step RL to full sequential settings, or integrated with memory‑augmented architectures like MemGen for more complex tasks.\n",

    "What problem does it solve?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors create a secret‑elicitation testbed. They fine‑tune LLMs to embed a secret in their internal reasoning - e.g., the model knows your gender and uses it to answer related questions - but also to deny the secret when asked directly. They then design black‑box and white‑box auditing attacks: prefill and persona sampling prompt the model with different prefixes to coax out the secret, while logit lens and sparse autoencoders inspect hidden activations. By measuring extraction success rates, they evaluate how readily secrets can be elicited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefill attacks are potent: In two of three setups, black‑box prefill attacks - adding crafted prefixes before the prompt - successfully elicited hidden secrets better than baseline methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "White‑box methods work elsewhere: In the remaining setting, white‑box techniques like logit lens and sparse autoencoder analysis were more effective, showing that direct inspection of internal activations can reveal concealed knowledge.\n",

    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "GEM (General Experience Maker) is an open‑source environment simulator specifically tailored for LLM agents. It defines a standard interface between an environment and an agent with support for asynchronous, vectorized execution (multiple parallel simulations), flexible wrappers, and integrated tools (e.g., Python code execution, retrieval). GEM comes with a diverse suite of environments - covering math, code, Q&A, and tool use - and baseline scripts for RL algorithms such as REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN). It also acts as an evaluation toolkit: researchers can plug in their agents and get comparable metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What problem does it solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "In RLVR, training performance often saturates because a small number of sampled trajectories rarely capture all possible reasoning paths. As training proceeds, the model’s behavior becomes increasingly deterministic, so RL sees less variance and stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSearch integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the RL training loop. Rather than sampling a few random rollouts, the agent performs a structured search over reasoning trajectories during training. Key components include:\n",

    "Global frontier selection: Prioritize exploring promising branches of the search tree, ensuring that high‑potential reasoning paths receive more attention.\n",

    "Watching: Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization (paper/code)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What problem does it solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised fine‑tuning (SFT) is sometimes criticized for producing models that memorize instruction templates and fail to generalize beyond them. In contrast, RL‑based methods like RLHF or RLVR are believed to achieve greater robustness. This paper challenges the belief that SFT inherently generalizes poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors identify two failure modes in SFT training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frozen prompt artifact: Training on fixed instruction templates causes the model to latch onto template semantics, leading to poor performance when prompts vary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Combining these two modifications yields an SFT model that generalizes across instruction styles and increased task difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt diversity alone improves style generalization: When models are exposed to varied instruction formats, they perform well on unseen prompt variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "CoT scaffolding improves difficulty generalization: Including chain‑of‑thought examples allows SFT models to tackle harder instances (e.g., bigger Sokoban puzzles) that they previously failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "SFT can match RL: With prompt diversity and CoT supervision, SFT models match or exceed the performance of RL‑trained policies on the tested tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next?\n",
    "\n",
    "This work encourages a data‑centric view of SFT: invest in diverse prompts and reasoning traces instead of resorting immediately to RL. Future research should explore combining SFT with other training regimes (e.g., RLMT or RLVR) and test generalization on real‑world tasks like code generation or tool use. A systematic benchmark of prompt diversity could help standardize evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "LLMs typically process input sequentially through stacked layers; complex reasoning often requires explicit chain‑of‑thought prompting and yields long outputs. Could models instead allocate extra compute to hard tokens internally, without writing out chain‑of‑thought?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughtbubbles is an architectural modification to Transformers. During pretraining, the model learns to “fork” a copy of its residual streams for certain tokens, effectively spawning parallel computational branches (bubbles). Hard tokens are assigned more computation steps; easy tokens flow through normally. The method is learned in an unsupervised manner using only the language modeling loss - no chain‑of‑thought supervision. After pretraining, tokens can trigger bubbles automatically, meaning inference uses the same mechanism as training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved perplexity: Across model sizes from 150M to 770M parameters, Thoughtbubbles consistently lowers perplexity on text corpora compared to standard decoders.\n",

    "Better zero‑shot reasoning: On reasoning benchmarks (HellaSwag, LAMBADA), Thoughtbubbles models outperform both standard Transformers and non‑adaptive parallel methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unified train/inference behavior: Because the mechanism is learned during pretraining, there is no discrepancy between training and inference; the model naturally allocates extra compute when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research may combine Thoughtbubbles with RL or search (e.g., MCTS) to allocate parallel computation across reasoning steps. Investigating bubble depth, merging strategies, and applying the idea to multimodal models could yield further gains. Additionally, interpretability studies may reveal how bubbles correspond to particular reasoning patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "Visual perception prior: Derived from broad natural language corpora, which include descriptions of everyday scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "They show that the reasoning prior scales strongly with model size and can transfer to vision tasks with minimal image exposure, whereas the perception prior saturates quickly and depends on pairing the LLM with a good vision encoder. They propose a data‑centric pretraining recipe: allocate a fraction of the pretraining to code/math to build reasoning priors, include a small amount of visual descriptions for perception, and then fine‑tune on a small multimodal dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning vs. perception priors: Reasoning priors come from structured text and scale with model size; perception priors come from broad language and saturate quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data efficiency: A moderate amount of reasoning‑centric text significantly increases visual reasoning ability. Including more descriptive text yields diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipe for vision‑aware LLMs: By controlling pretraining mixtures, the authors produce models that perform better on vision tasks after minimal image fine‑tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research may explore combining these priors with continuous latent CoT (see Thoughtbubbles) or generative diffusion models. Additionally, pretraining with explicit spatial reasoning tasks might build even stronger priors.

    "\n",
    "What problem does it solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning fine‑tuning often uses a fixed number of rollouts per problem. This uniform allocation wastes compute: easy tasks need few trials, and extremely hard tasks might never succeed with a tiny budget. As a result, many tasks yield zero gradients, wasting time and hindering learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knapsack RL treats exploration as a knapsack optimization problem: each task’s rollouts have a “cost” (compute) and a potential “value” (expected learning gain). By solving the knapsack problem across tasks, the algorithm allocates more rollouts to tasks with high expected benefit and fewer to those that are already solved or hopeless. This dynamic budgeting is built on top of the GRPO algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased gradient density: The ratio of non‑zero policy gradients rises by 20–40%, meaning the agent learns from more tasks each update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large budgets for hard tasks: Some extremely challenging tasks receive ~93 rollouts, unlocking exploration that a uniform budget would never allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance gains: On math reasoning benchmarks, Knapsack RL achieves 2–4 point average improvements and up to 9 points on specific instances while using half the compute that a uniform allocation would require.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Knapsack RL with BroRL could yield even better returns: broaden exploration globally and allocate budgets locally. It might also be paired with MCTS‑based training (see DeepSearch) or diversity objectives (see Polychromic RL) to further enhance exploration. Another avenue is extending the knapsack idea to multi‑agent or hierarchical tasks where budgets must be split across subtasks.\n",

    "How does it solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthRL introduces a ternary reward in RL fine‑tuning: positive reward for correct answers, a heavy penalty for hallucinations, and a mild positive reward for honest abstentions (“I don’t know”).

    "Memory trigger: A module monitors the agent’s current reasoning state and decides when to recall memory. It detects moments requiring recall of past experiences or facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory weaver: Once triggered, this module generates a sequence of latent tokens representing relevant memory content and injects them back into the model’s context. The memory is learned and represented in the model’s latent space, not as plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system allows the agent to pause, generate internal memory, and then resume reasoning with that memory fused into its hidden state. The agent learns to allocate memory content across working, procedural, and planning memory types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance gains: On eight diverse benchmarks, MemGen outperforms existing memory‑augmented agents (ExpeL, AWM) by up to 38.22% and surpasses a strong GRPO baseline by up to 13.44%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human‑like memory patterns: Without hand‑coding, MemGen agents spontaneously develop memory behaviors akin to planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, reminiscent of human cognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross‑domain generalization: The generative memory improves performance across multiple domains (math, programming, Q&A), suggesting it is broadly applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next?\n",
    "\n",
    "MemGen could be integrated with search‑based training (e.g., DeepSearch) or exploration scaling (BroRL) to further boost reasoning. Researchers may also explore training the memory trigger and weaver jointly with RL to learn when and what to recall for optimal rewards. Finally, combining MemGen with biologically inspired architectures like Dragon Hatchling could yield agents with both brain‑like memory and network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap‑Up – Insights and Future Directions\n",
    "Across these papers we see a convergence of themes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration is key: BroRL, DeepSearch, Knapsack RL, and Polychromic RL all emphasize different strategies for expanding and allocating exploration. By broadening rollouts, embedding search, optimizing budgets, or preserving multiple strategies, these works address RL’s tendency to get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectural innovation: Thoughtbubbles shows that unsupervised modifications can let LLMs think in parallel, MemGen introduces generative latent memory, Dragon Hatchling offers a biologically plausible alternative to Transformers. These innovations move beyond simple scale‑up, exploring new ways for models to process and store information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and generalization: Learning to See Before Seeing and Debunk SFT highlight the importance of training data quality and diversity over mere quantity. By curating reasoning‑centric texts or diverse prompts and CoT examples, we can unlock hidden capabilities in LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model auditing and alignment: Eliciting Secret Knowledge and TruthRL show that we must audit models for hidden knowledge and train them to be truthful and cautious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, combining these insights may yield next‑generation agents: large, biologically inspired networks with generative memory and parallel reasoning, trained via RL with broad exploration, calibrated truthfulness, and diverse supervision. The future of AI will likely involve multidisciplinary innovations spanning neuroscience, optimization, and safety research. Stay tuned!\n",

There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
