      "Absolutely! Here's a well-balanced 4-day upper/lower split tailored for an intermediate lifter like you, aiming for muscle growth. I’ve kept the emphasis on chest, back, and shoulders for the upper days, with biceps and triceps as secondary muscles. The plan includes warm-up sets to prepare your muscles, followed by 1-2 working sets to near failure for optimal hypertrophy. \n",
