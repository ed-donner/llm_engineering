       "Hey there! It's awesome you've got a decade of lifting under your belt and are still focused on building muscle. That's dedication! As an intermediate lifter, you're in a fantastic spot to really optimize your training for hypertrophy. You've got a good foundation, and we can build on that effectively.\n",

The idea with a full-body split is to hit each major muscle group multiple times a week, which is great for promoting growth. We'll keep the exercise selection focused and intense, so you get the most bang for your buck.\n",

       "*   **Progressive Overload:** The key to continued muscle growth is to gradually increase the demands on your muscles over time. This could mean adding a little weight, doing an extra rep, or improving your form. Keep a workout journal to track your progress!\n",

       "*   **Nutrition and Recovery:** Muscle growth happens outside the gym. Ensure you're eating enough protein and calories to support muscle repair and growth. Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n",
       "*   **Adjustments:** This is a template. Feel free to swap exercises if you have equipment limitations or find certain exercises don't agree with you. For example, if Barbell Bench Press aggravates your shoulders, switch to Dumbbell Bench Press as your primary chest movement.\n",
       "*   **Cardio:** While your primary goal is muscle building, don't neglect cardiovascular health. 1-2 moderate cardio sessions per week (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) are generally fine and can aid recovery without hindering muscle growth.\n",
       "\n",
