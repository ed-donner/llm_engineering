      "Hey there, fellow iron warrior! It's fantastic that you've been dedicated to lifting for over a decade. That kind of consistency is the bedrock of serious gains. As an intermediate lifter with that kind of experience, you're in a prime spot to really dial in your muscle-building efforts. A classic \"bro split\" can be incredibly effective for hypertrophy when programmed smartly, allowing each muscle group to get focused attention and ample recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's craft a routine that's efficient, effective, and keeps you pushing forward. Remember, \"failure\" means reaching a point where you can't complete another rep with good form. It's a powerful stimulus, but also taxing, so listen to your body and prioritize proper technique above all else.\n",

      "*   **Warm-up Sets:** These are lighter than your working sets and are designed to prepare the target muscles and joints. They don't count towards your total sets.\n",
      "*   **Working Sets to Failure:** These are where the magic happens! Push hard, but maintain strict form.\n",
      "*   **Rep Ranges:** These are geared towards hypertrophy (muscle growth). Aim for the lower end of the range when you're feeling strong and the higher end when you're pushing to your limit.\n",
      "*   **Rest:** Aim for 60-90 seconds of rest between working sets.\n",
      "*   **Progression:** As you get stronger, aim to increase the weight, reps, or improve your form over time. This is key to continued muscle growth!\n",
      "*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you're feeling unusually sore or fatigued, don't be afraid to adjust or take an extra rest day.\n",
