       "- **Sleep:** Aim for at least 7-9 hours per night. Deep sleep is critical for muscle repair.\n",
       "- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water daily, especially around workouts.\n",
       "- **Stretching & Mobility:** Incorporate 10-15 mins of stretching post-workout to reduce soreness.\n",
       "- **Foam Rolling/Massage:** Use foam rollers or get regular massages to reduce muscle tightness.\n",
       "- **Rest Days:** Use active rest or light cardio on Sundays or as needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Nutrition**\n",
       "- **Protein:** Consume 1.2-2.0 grams per kg of body weight daily (chicken, fish, lean beef, eggs, protein shakes).\n",
       "- **Carbohydrates:** Prioritize complex carbs (brown rice, oats, sweet potatoes) for energy.\n",
       "- **Fats:** Include healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil) for hormonal health.\n",
       "- **Supplements:** Consider whey protein, BCAAs, creatine, and multivitamins.\n",
       "- **Meal Timing:** Space meals evenly; consume a protein-rich meal within 30 mins post-workout.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Final Tips**\n",
       "- Focus on form over weight; high intensity with correct technique is key.\n",
       "- Use progressive overload — gradually increase weights or reps.\n",
       "- Listen to your body; don't ignore pain to avoid injury.\n",
       "- Keep your mindset disciplined; consistency is critical.\n",
