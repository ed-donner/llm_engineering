      "### **Key Principles & Tips for Success:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **High Intensity:** Use heavy weights that challenge you within the 8-10 rep range, reaching momentary muscular failure on each set.\n",
      "- **Rest Periods:** Maintain strict rest periods of 1.5 to 3 minutes to keep intensity high and ensure recovery between sets.\n",
      "- **Form First:** Prioritize perfect form—never sacrifice technique for heavier weights.\n",
      "- **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weights over time, aiming to surpass previous benchmarks each week.\n",
      "- **Recovery & Nutrition:**\n",
      "  - **Protein:** Aim for 1.2-2.0 grams of protein per kg of body weight daily to support muscle repair.\n",
      "  - **Sleep:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly.\n",
      "  - **Rest Days:** Incorporate at least 1-2 rest days or active recovery days (light cardio, stretching).\n",
      "  - **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated to facilitate optimal recovery.\n",
      "  - **Supplements:** Consider whey protein, creatine, and BCAAs to enhance performance and recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Additional Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Warm-up thoroughly** before each session—especially for compound lifts.\n",
      "- **Cooldown and stretch** post-workout to enhance flexibility and reduce soreness.\n",
      "- **Stay consistent** with your routine; Yates' training philosophy thrives on intensity over volume but requires dedication.\n",
