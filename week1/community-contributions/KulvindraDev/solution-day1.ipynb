Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

Adding two and two together is fundamental.\\n\\nWait, maybe they just want the straightforward answer? Let me confirm. The question is pretty simple, so the answer should be 4. But maybe there\\'s more to it. Sometimes people ask this as a trick question or to test if the responder is functioning correctly. For example, in some contexts, like in the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the computer says 6 when asked 2+2, but that\\'s a fictional scenario. In reality, 2 + 2 is definitely 4.\\n\\nLet me check the addition again. 2 plus 2. If I count two apples and add two more apples, that\\'s four apples. So numerically, it\\'s 4. I can also think in terms of binary, but unless specified, numbers are in base 10. So no, there\\'s no trick here. The answer is 4.\\n\\nWait, could there be any other interpretation? Like, in different number bases? For example, in base 3, 2 + 2 would be 11, but that\\'s if they\\'re using base 3. However, the question doesn\\'t mention a specific base, so it\\'s safe to assume base 10. So the answer is still 4.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if I know basic math. I should just answer directly. Sometimes people might say \"Wait, isn\\'t it 5 in some contexts?\" but no, standard arithmetic says 4. No, no other context is given here. So, the answer is definitely 4.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe sum of 2 and 2 is **4**.
