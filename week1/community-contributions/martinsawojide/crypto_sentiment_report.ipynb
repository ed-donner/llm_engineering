            "Bitcoin rallied over 3% to surpass $66,000, closely following gains in the US stock market led by tech and AI sectors. Despite a weak correlation with gold and stocks—the lowest since 2022—this divergence historically signals potential significant upside for Bitcoin upon price reversion. Notably, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index turned positive amid $258 million in ETF inflows, suggesting renewed investor interest. The rally is seen as an attempt to halt Bitcoin's 2026 slump, with the market watching for a delayed but substantial recovery.\n",

            "Bitcoin rebounded past $66,000 with a 2.5% gain amid speculation of selling pressure from Wall Street trading firm Jane Street. Rumors claim Jane Street engaged in coordinated daily algorithmic selling of Bitcoin at 10 a.m. Eastern time, contributing to BTC's prolonged price declines since October 2025. Jane Street has denied any manipulation allegations linked to the 2022 bear market and the Terraform Labs collapse. The episode highlights the market's \"razor-thin\" order books causing notable price volatility and ongoing debate among traders.\n",

This inflow reversed Monday's $203.8 million outflows, bringing weekly ETF flows back to positive territory after five weeks and $3.8 billion in cumulative redemptions.

The ETF flows suggest more buyers lurking, but the lingering shadow of big Q4 dumps and wash trading rumors could spark sharp pullbacks. If Bitcoin can shake off the noise and prove this rebound’s solid, it might just be gearing up for a surprise comeback — but don’t blink, it’s still a razor’s edge game."

            "Ether (ETH) experienced a sharp price drop to $1,800, liquidating $224 million in leveraged bullish positions over 48 hours and causing a 14% slide over 10 days. Onchain activity reached a 12-month low, and ETH's strong correlation with Bitcoin along with outflows from Ether ETFs signal further downside risk. Options data showed a significant rise in put (sell) options demand, with the put-to-call volume premium hitting 2.2x and an 18% delta skew reflecting a market focus on downside protection and hedging.\n",

            "Ether whale activity has slowed in early 2026, with average whale sell orders on Binance dropping from around 2,250 ETH to 1,350 ETH in recent weeks. Despite a six-week losing streak – the worst since 2022 – whale-sized transactions totaled roughly 1.8 to 2 million ETH over 45 days, equating to between $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion at an average price of $2,400. Analysts interpret the decline in order size as a \"gradual disengagement\" of large players, indicating a tightening liquidity scenario for ETH near the $2,000 price level.\n",

            "Ethereum fell below $1,900 during Asian trading, extending a 38% loss over 30 days amid weak technicals and ongoing ETF outflows. The price drop reflects bearish signals such as ETH trading below its realized price, typically associated with bearish continuation phases. Market indicators suggest the ETH bottom may not be reached until key metrics like the 50-week moving average align, indicating further downside risk before potential recovery.\n",

Traders are loading up on puts, locking in downside protection with the put-to-call ratio spiking 2.2x. Whales are stepping back too, selling less on Binance and signaling a tighter liquidity squeeze around $2,000. With ETF outflows and ETH’s correlation to Bitcoin dragging it down, the mood is heavy and cautious.\n",

              "Watch the $1,800 to $2,000 zone closely — it’s the battleground before any real bounce. Whales’ quieter moves and on-chain lows suggest sellers might still have the edge. If ETH can’t find support near these levels, the slide could linger longer. Bottom line — bears aren’t done yet, so strap in and keep your eyes on the charts."

Despite exploring options like financing and acquisitions, Step Finance said it could not find a viable solution to continue.

Prediction markets show a 72% chance that BTC could fall below $55,000, aligning with many analysts’ expectations.

The fallout from Step Finance’s loss is still rippling, as they scramble to buy back tokens and compensate victims, but the damage is done.
