       "- Tell us about your renewal experience with Axis Max Life Insurance\n",
       "\n",
       "Security and authenticity assessment\n",
       "- Potential security threats\n",
       "  - The email uses a generic greeting (\"Dear Customer\") and lacks personalized details (e.g., policy number, full name, contact info), which is common in phishing attempts.\n",
       "  - The message centers on a call-to-action to click a \"Start Survey\" button. If the link is malicious, this could lead to a phishing site. The content does not include verifiable contact details or a physical address.\n",
       "  - Branding mentions (\"Axis Max Life Insurance (formerly Max Life Insurance)\") and a promotional tagline in a mixed language style, which can be a red flag if the branding doesn’t align with official communications you’ve received before.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phishing indicators to watch for\n",
       "  - Absence of policy specifics or credible identifiers (policy number, customer ID).\n",
       "  - No legitimate contact details (phone, official email, or postal address).\n",
       "  - A CTA button that leads to an external site rather than directing you to a known official portal.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Links/attachments suspicion\n",
       "  - The email references a button (\"Start Survey\") but no URL is visible in the text you provided. If you see a hyperlink, hover over it (without clicking) to inspect the domain. If the domain does not match the official Axis Max Life/Max Life website, treat it as suspicious.\n",
       "  - No attachments are shown here, but be cautious of any attachments claiming survey data or policy documents.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Recommendations to verify safely\n",
       "  - Do not click the button or open any links from this email until you verify its legitimacy.\n",
       "  - Check the sender’s email address and domain. Compare it to official Axis Max Life Insurance contact domains you already trust.\n",
       "  - If in doubt, independently navigate to the official Axis Max Life Insurance website or use your known customer app/portal, and look for any recent survey invitations under your account.\n",
       "  - Contact Axis Max Life Insurance customer support using a verified phone number or email from the official website to confirm whether this survey notification is legitimate.\n",
       "  - If you want to share feedback, use official channels you’ve used before (e.g., login to your policy portal) instead of any email links.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you’d like, I can help you draft a cautious reply to the sender or help you verify the sender’s details using publicly accessible contact information."
