       "This is a personal website for Edward \"Ed\" Donner, a self-proclaimed LLM enthusiast and AI engineer. The site serves as a hub for his professional pursuits, which include:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **A Personal Introduction:** Ed presents himself as a code-writer, AI experimenter, and former startup founder (acquired in 2021). His current mission is applying AI to help people \"discover their potential\" at Nebula.io. He also confesses to a love for amateur music and nodding sagely at Hacker News threads.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **An Educational Venture:** Frustrated friends reportedly begged him to turn his LLM lectures into courses. He did, and the result is a best-selling Udemy curriculum (400,000 students across 190 countries) aimed at creating \"Proficient AI Engineers.\" He directs visitors to the full curriculum.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Interactive AI Arenas:** The site features links to playful projects like \"Connect Four\" and \"Outsmart,\" the latter billed as an arena where LLMs battle in \"diplomacy and deviousness.\" This suggests a penchant for testing AI beyond standard benchmarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **A Niche Blog:** The \"Posts\" section offers dated entries focusing on AI technical topics (like MLOps and voice agents) and the \"unique energy\" of live AI events, hinting at an intersection of tech and community.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **A Standard Professional Footer:** The navigation and contact section includes a newsletter signup, email contact, and links to social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook), solidifying its role as a personal brand and funnel for his courses and content.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Thought-Provoking Questions:**\n",
       "Given your extensive course catalog, do you ever worry that the rapid evolution of AI will obsolete your material before the ink (or pixels) are dry? And for the \"Outsmart\" arena, how exactly does one adjudicate a battle of \"deviousness\" between models—by the number of clever lies told, or the elegance of the trap laid?"
