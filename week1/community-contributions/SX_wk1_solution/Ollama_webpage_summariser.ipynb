       "> *Bottom line:* Ed's website is a showcase of his self‑made celebrity status in the AI world, a generous (and apparently very popular) education product, and a subtle invitation to become his loyal subscriber. If you're wondering whether you truly need an Udemy course to feel like an AI prodigy, this page is the best place to start the debate."
