# AI Immigration & Citizenship Guidance Assistant(By Habila Victor)

## Overview

This project scrapes official government immigration or citizenship
guidance pages, extracts visible readable text, and uses an OpenAI model
to generate a concise, structured, and personalized summary based on a
defined user profile.

The system demonstrates how web scraping and large language models can
be combined to transform complex immigration policy pages into clear,
practical guidance tailored to an individual’s situation.

The assistant works with **any country**, provided you supply an
official government immigration website.

## Key Features

* Scrapes one official government immigration page
* Extracts clean visible text (no raw HTML sent to the model)
* Accepts a custom immigration profile
* Sends structured prompts to an OpenAI model
* Generates clear, personalized summaries
* Highlights eligibility, documents, timelines, and next steps
* Outputs clean Markdown formatting for readability

## Use Case

The primary goal is to:

* Analyze official immigration or citizenship guidance
* Identify eligibility requirements
* Extract required documents and timelines
* Highlight important rules or conditions
* Tailor information to a specific user profile

Example output includes:

### Overview

* What the page covers
* Who it applies to
* Legal or policy references (if mentioned)

### Key Requirements

* Eligibility criteria
* Required documents
* Fees
* Application steps

### Personalized Guidance

* What matters most for the user’s profile
* Risks or common pitfalls
* Missing information the user should clarify

### Important Notes

* Effective dates (if stated)
* Limitations
* Verification reminder

## Tech Stack

* Python 3
* Requests
* BeautifulSoup
* OpenAI Python SDK
* python-dotenv
* Jupyter Notebook (optional)

---

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openai python-dotenv ipython
```

---

## Environment Setup

Set your OpenAI API key before running the script.

Create a `.env` file in the project directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_api_key_here
```

Or set it manually:

### macOS / Linux

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

Restart your terminal or notebook after setting the key.

## How It Works

### 1. Scraping Phase

* A single official government immigration page is requested
* HTML is parsed using BeautifulSoup
* Scripts, styles, and non-visible elements are removed
* Clean readable text is extracted
* Raw HTML is not sent to the model

### 2. AI Analysis Phase

* The page title, URL, extracted text, and user profile are sent to the model
* The model generates a structured immigration summary
* The output is formatted in Markdown for clarity
* The response is tailored specifically to the user’s situation

## Example Usage

Define your immigration profile:

```
user_profile = """
I am in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa.
I want to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain next year.
"""
```

Provide the official government website:

```
website_url = "https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain"
```

Run the script:

```
python your_script_name.py
```
