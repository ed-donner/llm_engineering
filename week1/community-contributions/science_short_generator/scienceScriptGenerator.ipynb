      "Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon wherein the quantum state of each particle in a group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical physics and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n",
      "Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. This behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n",
      "Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n",
      "Later, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified in tests where polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations, statistically violating Bell's inequality. This established that the correlations produced from quantum entanglement cannot be explained in terms of local hidden variables, i.e., properties contained within the individual particles themselves.\n",
      "Entanglement can produce statistical correlations between events in widely separated places, but it cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.\n",
      "Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with photons, electrons, top quarks, molecules and even small diamonds. The use of quantum entanglement in communication and computation is an active area of research and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "History\n",
      "Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr engaged in a long-running collegial dispute over the interpretation of quantum mechanics, now known as the Bohr–Einstein debates. During these debates, Einstein introduced a thought experiment involving a box that emits a photon. He noted that the experimenter's choice of which measurement to make on the box would change what can be predicted about the photon, even when the photon is very far away. This argument, which Einstein had formulated by 1931, was an early recognition of what would later be called entanglement. That same year, Hermann Weyl observed in his textbook on group theory and quantum mechanics that quantum systems composed of multiple interacting parts exhibit a kind of Gestalt, in which \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". In 1932, Erwin Schrödinger derived the defining equations of quantum entanglement but left them unpublished. In 1935, Grete Hermann studied the mathematics of an electron interacting with a photon and noted the phenomenon that would later be called entanglement. Later that same year, Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published a paper on what is now known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox, a thought experiment that attempted to show that \"the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete\". Their thought experiment considered two systems that interact and then separate, and they argued that, afterward, quantum mechanics could not describe the two systems individually.\n",
      "Shortly after this paper appeared, Erwin Schrödinger wrote a letter to Einstein in German in which he used the word Verschränkung (translated by himself as entanglement) to describe situations like that of the EPR scenario. Schrödinger followed up with a full paper defining and discussing the notion of entanglement, saying \"I would not call [entanglement] one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought.\" \n",
      "Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity. Einstein later disparaged quantum mechanics for seemingly exhibiting \"spukhafte Fernwirkung\" or \"spooky action at a distance\", meaning the acquisition of a value of a property at one location resulting from a measurement at a distant location.\n",
      "In 1946, John Archibald Wheeler suggested studying the polarization of pairs of gamma-ray photons produced by electron–positron annihilation. Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov carried out this experiment in 1949, thereby demonstrating that the entangled particle pairs considered by EPR could be created in the laboratory.\n",
      "Despite Schrödinger's claim of its importance, little work on entanglement was published for decades after his paper was published. In 1964 John S. Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in Bell's inequality, regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying local realism, and showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems. His inequality is experimentally testable, and there have been numerous relevant experiments, starting with the pioneering work of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972 and Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982.\n",
      "While Bell actively discouraged students from pursuing work like his as too esoteric, after a talk at Oxford a student named Artur Ekert suggested that the violation of a Bell inequality could be used as a resource for communication. Ekert followed up by  publishing a quantum key distribution  protocol called E91 based on it.\n",
      "In 1992, the entanglement concept was leveraged to propose quantum teleportation, an effect that was realized experimentally in 1997.\n",
      "Beginning in the mid-1990s, Anton Zeilinger used the generation of entanglement via parametric down-conversion to develop entanglement swapping and demonstrate quantum cryptography with entangled photons.\n",
      "In 2022, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Concept\n",
      "Meaning of entanglement\n",
      "Just as energy is a resource that facilitates mechanical operations, entanglement is a resource that facilitates performing tasks that involve communication and computation. The mathematical definition of entanglement can be paraphrased as saying that maximal knowledge about the whole of a system does not imply maximal knowledge about the individual parts of that system. If the quantum state that describes a pair of particles is entangled, then the results of measurements upon one half of the pair can be strongly correlated with the results of measurements upon the other. However, entanglement is not the same as \"correlation\" as understood in classical probability theory and in daily life. Instead, entanglement can be thought of as potential correlation that can be used to generate actual correlation in an appropriate experiment. The correlations generated from an entangled quantum state cannot in general be replicated by classical probability.\n",
      "An example of entanglement is a subatomic particle that decays into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various conservation laws, and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a spin-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-1/2 particles. If there is no orbital angular momentum, the total spin angular momentum after this decay must be zero (by the conservation of angular momentum). Whenever the first particle is measured to be spin up on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be spin down. This is called the spin anti-correlated case and the pair is said to be in the singlet state. Perfect anti-correlations like this could be explained by \"hidden variables\" within the particles. For example, we could hypothesize that the particles are made in pairs such that one carries a value of \"up\" while the other carries a value of \"down\". Then, knowing the result of the spin measurement upon one particle, we could predict that the other will have the opposite value. Bell illustrated this with a story about a colleague, Bertlmann, who always wore socks with mismatching colors. \"Which colour he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable,\" Bell wrote, but upon observing \"that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink.\" Revealing the remarkable features of quantum entanglement requires considering multiple distinct experiments, such as spin measurements along different axes, and comparing the correlations obtained in these different configurations.\n",
      "Quantum systems can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on methods. Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles decohere through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made. In more detail, this process involves the particles becoming entangled with the environment, as a consequence of which, the quantum state describing \n"

      "A delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment is an elaboration on the quantum eraser experiment that incorporates concepts considered in John Archibald Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment. The experiment was designed to investigate peculiar consequences of the well-known double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics, as well as the consequences of quantum entanglement.\n",
      "Delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments are designed to investigate the following apparent paradox arising from the traditional double-slit experiment: if, upon observing a photon, one can deduce that it arrived at a detector by following a particular path, then \"common sense\" (which Wheeler and others challenge) says that it must have entered the double-slit device as a particle, whereas if the photon's path cannot be deduced, then it must have entered the double-slit device as a wave. By this logic, a spontaneous change in the mode of observation while the photon is in transit may force it to retroactively alter its initial \"commitment\" to exhibiting either wave-like or particle-like behavior. Wheeler pointed out that, if one imagines an experimental setup of interstellar proportions, this reasoning suggests that a last-minute decision made on Earth on how to observe a photon could alter a physical configuration established millions or even billions of years earlier.\n",
      "While delayed-choice experiments might seem to allow decisions (about how to make measurements) to alter events that have already occurred by the time they have been made, this conclusion may only be reached by adopting a non-standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. Under the standard interpretation, a photon in transit is considered to be in a superposition of states only one of which is observed in the measurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "In the basic double-slit experiment, a coherent beam of light (in practice, often a laser) is directed at two (parallel) narrow vertical slits in an otherwise solid barrier. If a detection screen is placed at a sufficient distance from the barrier on the other side, one will observe an interference pattern of alternating light and dark fringes. Other atomic-scale entities such as electrons are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired toward a double slit. By decreasing the brightness of the source sufficiently, individual particles that form the interference pattern are detectable. The emergence of an interference pattern suggests that each particle passing through the slits interferes with itself, and that therefore in some sense the particles are going through both slits at once. This is an idea that contradicts our everyday experience of discrete objects.\n",
      "A well-known thought experiment, which played a vital role in the history of quantum mechanics (for example, see the discussion on Einstein's version of this experiment), demonstrated that if particle detectors are positioned at the slits, showing through which slit a photon goes, the interference pattern will disappear. This which-way experiment illustrates the complementarity principle that photons can behave as either particles or as waves, but cannot be simultaneously observed to be both a particle and a wave. \n",
      "Technical challenges of the thought experiment prevented realizations of this experiment before the 1970s; similar experiments can now be performed in undergraduate physics labs.\n",
      "Which-path information and the visibility of interference fringes are complementary quantities, meaning that information about a photon's path can be observed, or interference fringes can be observed, but they cannot both be observed in the same trial. In the double-slit experiment, conventional wisdom held that observing the particles' path inevitably disturbed them enough to destroy the interference pattern as a result of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n",
      "In 1982, Scully and Drühl pointed out a workaround alternative to this interpretation.  They proposed to save the information about which slit the photon went through - or, in their setup, from which atom the photon was re-emitted - in the excited state of that atom. At this point the which-path information is known and no interference is observed. However, one can \"erase\" this information by making the atom emit another photon and fall to the ground state. That on its own will not bring the interference pattern back, the which-path information can still be extracted from an appropriate measurement of the second photon. However, if the second photon is measured at a place where it could get to equally likely from any of the atoms, that successfully \"erases\" the which-path information. The original photon would now show the interference pattern (the position of its fringes depends on where exactly the second photon was observed, so that in the total statistics they average out and no fringes are seen). Since 1982, multiple experiments have demonstrated the validity of this so-called quantum \"eraser\". A form of the experiment closely matching Scully  and Drühl concept was performed in 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple quantum-eraser experiment\n",
      "A simple version of the quantum eraser can be described as follows: Rather than splitting one photon or its probability wave between two slits, the photon is subjected to a beam splitter. If one thinks in terms of a stream of photons being randomly directed by such a beam splitter to go down two paths that are kept from interaction, it would seem that no photon can then interfere with any other or with itself.\n",
      "If the rate of photon production is reduced so that only one photon enters the apparatus at any one time, it becomes impossible to understand the photon as only moving through one path, because when the path outputs are redirected so that they coincide on a common detector or detectors, interference phenomena appear. This is similar to envisioning one photon in a two-slit apparatus: even though it is one photon, it still somehow interacts with both slits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the two diagrams in Fig. 1, photons are emitted one at a time from a laser symbolized by a yellow star. They pass through a 50% beam splitter (green block) that reflects or transmits 1/2 of the photons.  The reflected or transmitted photons travel along two possible paths depicted by the red or blue lines.\n",
      "In the top diagram, it seems as though the trajectories of the photons are known: If a photon emerges from the top of the apparatus, it seems as though it had to have come by way of the blue path, and if it emerges from the side of the apparatus, it seems as though it had to have come by way of the red path. However, it is important to keep in mind that the photon is in a superposition of the paths until it is detected.

      "In the bottom diagram, a second beam splitter is introduced at the top right. It recombines the beams corresponding to the red and blue paths. By introducing the second beam splitter, the usual way of thinking is that the path information has been \"erased.\" However, we have to be careful, because the photon cannot be assumed to have 'really' gone along one or the other path. Recombining the beams results in interference phenomena at detection screens positioned just beyond each exit port. What issues to the right side displays reinforcement, and what issues toward the top displays cancellation. It is important to keep in mind however that the illustrated interferometer effects apply only to a single photon in a pure state. When dealing with a pair of entangled photons, the photon encountering the interferometer will be in a mixed state, and there will be no visible interference pattern without coincidence counting to select appropriate subsets of the data.\n",

      "Entanglement swapping has two pairs of entangled particles: (A, B) and (C, D). Pair of particles (A, B) is initially entangled, as is the pair (C, D). The pair (B, C) taken from the original pairs, is projected onto one of the four possible Bell states, a process called a Bell state measurement. The unmeasured pair of particles (A, D) can become entangled. This effect happens without any previous direct interaction between particles A and D.\n",

      "### Wikipedia Summary: \n",
      "A Bell test, also known as Bell inequality test or Bell experiment, is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics in relation to Albert Einstein's concept of local realism. Named for John Stewart Bell, the experiments test whether or not the real world satisfies local realism, which requires the presence of some additional local variables (called \"hidden\" because they are not a feature of quantum theory) to explain the behavior of particles like photons and electrons. The test empirically evaluates the implications of Bell's theorem. As of 2015, all Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems behave.\n",
      "Many types of Bell tests have been performed in physics laboratories, often with the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as \"closing loopholes in Bell tests\".\n",
      "Bell inequality violations are also used in some quantum cryptography protocols, whereby a spy's presence is detected when Bell's inequalities cease to be violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "The Bell test has its origins in the debate between Einstein and other pioneers of quantum physics, principally Niels Bohr.  One feature of the theory of quantum mechanics under debate was the meaning of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  This principle states that if some information is known about a given particle, there is some other information about it that is impossible to know.  An example of this is found in observations of the position and the momentum of a given particle.  According to the uncertainty principle, a particle's momentum and its position cannot simultaneously be determined with arbitrarily high precision.\n",
      "In 1935, Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen published a claim that quantum mechanics predicts that more information about a pair of entangled particles could be observed than Heisenberg's principle allowed, which would only be possible if information were travelling instantly between the two particles. This produces a paradox which came to be known as the \"EPR paradox\" after the three authors. It arises if any effect felt in one location is not the result of a cause that occurred in its past light cone, relative to its location. This action at a distance seems to violate causality, by allowing information between the two locations to travel faster than the speed of light. However, it is a common misconception to think that any information can be shared between two observers faster than the speed of light using entangled particles; the hypothetical information transfer here is between the particles. See no-communication theorem for further explanation.\n",
      "Based on this, the authors concluded that the quantum wave function does not provide a complete description of reality.  They suggested that there must be some local hidden variables at work in order to account for the behavior of entangled particles.  In a theory of hidden variables, as Einstein envisaged it, the randomness and indeterminacy seen in the behavior of quantum particles would only be apparent.  For example, if one knew the details of all the hidden variables associated with a particle, then one could predict both its position and momentum.  The uncertainty that had been quantified by Heisenberg's principle would simply be an artifact of not having complete information about the hidden variables.  Furthermore, Einstein argued that the hidden variables should obey the condition of locality:  Whatever the hidden variables actually are, the behavior of the hidden variables for one particle should not be able to instantly affect the behavior of those for another particle far away.  This idea, called the principle of locality, is rooted in intuition from classical physics that physical interactions do not propagate instantly across space.  These ideas were the subject of ongoing debate between their proponents. In particular, Einstein himself did not approve of the way Podolsky had stated the problem in the famous EPR paper.\n",
      "In 1964, John Stewart Bell proposed his famous theorem, which states that no physical theory of hidden local variables can ever reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.  Implicit in the theorem is the proposition that the determinism of classical physics is fundamentally incapable of describing quantum mechanics.  Bell expanded on the theorem to provide what would become the conceptual foundation of the Bell test experiments.\n",
      "A typical experiment involves the observation of particles, often photons, in an apparatus designed to produce entangled pairs and allow for the measurement of some characteristic of each, such as their spin. The results of the experiment could then be compared to what was predicted by local realism and those predicted by quantum mechanics.\n",
      "In theory, the results could be \"coincidentally\" consistent with both. To address this problem, Bell proposed a mathematical description of local realism that placed a statistical limit on the likelihood of that eventuality.  If the results of an experiment violate Bell's inequality, local hidden variables can be ruled out as their cause.  Later researchers built on Bell's work by proposing new inequalities that serve the same purpose and refine the basic idea in one way or another.  Consequently, the term \"Bell inequality\" can mean any one of a number of inequalities satisfied by local hidden-variables theories; in practice, many present-day experiments employ the CHSH inequality. All these inequalities, like the original devised by Bell, express the idea that assuming local realism places restrictions on the statistical results of experiments on sets of particles that have taken part in an interaction and then separated.\n",
      "To date, all Bell tests have supported the theory of quantum physics, and not the hypothesis of local hidden variables. These efforts to experimentally validate violations of the Bell inequalities resulted in John Clauser, Alain Aspect, and Anton Zeilinger being awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conduct of optical Bell test experiments\n",
      "In practice most actual experiments have used light, assumed to be emitted in the form of particle-like photons (produced by atomic cascade or spontaneous parametric down conversion), rather than the atoms that Bell originally had in mind. The property of interest is, in the best known experiments, the polarisation direction, though other properties can be used. Such experiments fall into two classes, depending on whether the analysers used have one or two output channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical CHSH (two-channel) experiment\n",
      "The diagram shows a typical optical experiment of the two-channel kind for which Alain Aspect set a precedent in 1982. Coincidences (simultaneous detections) are recorded, the results being categorised as '++', '+−', '−+' or '−−' and corresponding counts accumulated.\n",
      "Four separate subexperiments are conducted, corresponding to the four terms E(a, b) in the test statistic S (equation (2) shown below). The settings a, a′, b and b′ are generally in practice chosen to be 0, 45°, 22.5° and 67.5° respectively — the \"Bell test angles\" — these being the ones for which the quantum mechanical formula gives the greatest violation of the inequality.\n",
      "For each selected value of a and b, the numbers of coincidences in each category (N++, N−−, N+− and N−+) are recorded. The experimental estimate for E(a, b) is then calculated as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Once all four E's have been estimated, an experimental estimate of the test statistic\n",
      "\n",
      "can be found. If S is numerically greater than 2 it has infringed the CHSH inequality. The experiment is declared to have supported the QM prediction and ruled out all local hidden-variable theories.\n",
      "A strong assumption has had to be made, however, to justify use of expression (2), namely, that the sample of detected pairs is representative of the pairs emitted by the source. Denial of this assumption is called the fair sampling loophole.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical CH74 (single-channel) experiment\n",
      "Prior to 1982 all actual Bell tests used \"single-channel\" polarisers and variations on an inequality designed for this setup. The latter is described in Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt's much-cited 1969 article as being the one suitable for practical use. As with the CHSH test, there are four subexperiments in which each polariser takes one of two possible settings, but in addition there are other subexperiments in which one or other polariser or both are absent. Counts are taken as before and used to estimate the test statistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "where the symbol ∞ indicates absence of a polariser.\n",
      "If S exceeds 0 then the experiment is declared to have infringed the CH inequality and hence to have refuted local hidden-variables. This inequality is known as CH inequality instead of CHSH as it was also derived in a 1974 article by Clauser and Horne more rigorously and under weaker assumptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experimental assumptions\n",
      "In addition to the theoretical assumptions, there are practical ones. There may, for example, be a number of \"accidental coincidences\" in addition to those of interest. It is assumed that no bias is introduced by subtracting their estimated number before calculating S, but that this is true is not considered by some to be obvious. There may be synchronisation problems — ambiguity in recognising pairs because in practice they will not be detected at exactly the same time.\n",
      "Nevertheless, despite all the deficiencies of the actual experiments, one striking fact emerges: the results are, to a very good approximation, what quantum mechanics predicts. If imperfect experiments give us such excellent overlap with quantum predictions, most working quantum physicists would agree with John Bell in expecting that, when a perfect Bell test is done, the Bell inequalities will still be violated. This attitude has led to the emergence of a new sub-field \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Wikipedia Summary: \n",
      "In physics, the no-communication theorem (also referred to as the no-signaling principle) is a no-go theorem in quantum information theory. It asserts that during the measurement of an entangled quantum state, it is impossible for one observer to transmit information to another observer, regardless of their spatial separation. This conclusion preserves the principle of causality in quantum mechanics and ensures that information transfer does not violate special relativity by exceeding the speed of light.\n",
      "The theorem is significant because quantum entanglement creates correlations between distant events that might initially appear to enable faster-than-light communication. The no-communication theorem demonstrates that the failure of local causality does not imply that \"spooky action at a distance,\" a phrase originally coined by Einstein, can be used to communicate faster than light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Informal overview\n",
      "The no-communication theorem states that, within the context of quantum mechanics, it is not possible to transmit classical bits of information by means of carefully prepared mixed or pure states, whether entangled or not. The theorem is only a sufficient condition that states that if the Kraus matrices commute then there can be no communication through the quantum entangled states and that this is applicable to all communication. From a relativity and quantum field perspective, also faster than light or \"instantaneous\" communication is disallowed. Being only a sufficient condition, there can be other reasons communication is not allowed.\n",
      "The basic premise entering into the theorem is that a quantum-mechanical system is prepared in an initial state with some entangled states, and that this initial state is describable as a mixed or pure state in a Hilbert space H. After a certain amount of time, the system is divided in two parts each of which contains some non-entangled states and half of the quantum entangled states, and the two parts become spatially distinct, A and B, sent to two distinct observers, Alice and Bob, who are free to perform quantum mechanical measurements on their portion of the total system (viz, A and B). The question is: is there any action that Alice can perform on A that would be detectable by Bob making an observation of B? The theorem replies 'no'.\n",
      "An important assumption going into the theorem is that neither Alice nor Bob is allowed, in any way, to affect the preparation of the initial state. If Alice were allowed to take part in the preparation of the initial state, it would be trivially easy for her to encode a message into it; thus neither Alice nor Bob participates in the preparation of the initial state.  The theorem does not require that the initial state be somehow 'random' or 'balanced' or 'uniform': indeed, a third party preparing the initial state could easily encode messages in it, received by Alice and Bob. Simply, the theorem states that, given some initial state, prepared in some way, there is no action that Alice can take that would be detectable by Bob.\n",
      "The proof proceeds by defining how the total Hilbert space H can be split into two parts, HA and HB, describing the subspaces accessible to Alice and Bob. The total state of the system is described by a density matrix σ. The goal of the theorem is to prove that Bob cannot in any way distinguish the pre-measurement state σ from the post-measurement state P(σ).  This is accomplished mathematically by comparing the trace of σ and the trace of P(σ), with the trace being taken over the subspace HA. Since the trace is only over a subspace, it is technically called a partial trace. Key to this step is that the (partial) trace adequately summarizes the system from Bob's point of view. That is, everything that Bob has access to, or could ever have access to, measure, or detect, is completely described by a partial trace over HA of the system σ.  The fact that this trace never changes as Alice performs her measurements is the conclusion of the proof of the no-communication theorem.\n",

      "Quantum teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away. While teleportation is commonly portrayed in science fiction as a means to transfer physical objects from one location to the next, quantum teleportation only transfers quantum information. The sender does not have to know the particular quantum state being transferred. Moreover, the location of the recipient can be unknown, but to complete the quantum teleportation, classical information needs to be sent from sender to receiver. Because classical information needs to be sent, quantum teleportation cannot occur faster than the speed of light.\n",
      "One of the first scientific articles to investigate quantum teleportation is \"Teleporting an Unknown Quantum State via Dual Classical and Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen Channels\" published by C. H. Bennett, G. Brassard, C. Crépeau, R. Jozsa, A. Peres, and W. K. Wootters in 1993, in which they proposed using dual communication methods to send/receive quantum information. It was experimentally realized in 1997 by two research groups, led by Sandu Popescu and Anton Zeilinger, respectively.\n",
      "Experimental determinations of quantum teleportation have been made in information content – including photons, atoms, electrons, and superconducting circuits – as well as distance, with 1,400 km (870 mi) being the longest distance of successful teleportation by Jian-Wei Pan's team using the Micius satellite for space-based quantum teleportation.\n",

      "In matters relating to quantum information theory, it is convenient to work with the simplest possible unit of information: the two-state system of the qubit. The qubit functions as the quantum analog of the classic computational part, the bit. Unlike a bit which always acts as either a 0 or a 1, a qubit can behave as a combination of both a 0 and a 1 until the computation is over. The quantum two-state system seeks to transfer quantum information from one location to another location without losing the information and preserving the quality of this information. This process involves moving the information between carriers and not movement of the actual carriers, similar to the traditional process of communications, as two parties remain stationary while the information (digital media, voice, text, etc.) is being transferred, contrary to the implications of the word \"teleport\". The main components needed for teleportation include a sender, the information (a qubit), a traditional channel, a quantum channel, and a receiver. The sender does not need to know the exact contents of the information being sent. The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics – when a measurement is made upon a quantum state, any subsequent measurements will \"collapse\" or that the observed state will be lost – creates an imposition within teleportation: if a sender measures their information, the state could collapse when the receiver obtains the data since the state had changed from when the sender made the initial measurement and in so making it different.\n",
      "\n",
      "For actual teleportation, it is required that an entangled quantum state be created for the qubit to be transferred. Entanglement imposes statistical correlations between otherwise distinct physical systems by creating or placing two or more separate particles into a single, shared quantum state. This intermediate state contains two particles whose quantum states are related to each other: measuring one particle's state provides information about the measurement of the other particle's state. These correlations hold even when measurements are chosen and performed independently, out of causal contact from one another, as verified in Bell test experiments. Thus, an observation resulting from a measurement choice made at one point in spacetime seems to instantaneously affect outcomes in another region, even though light hasn't yet had time to travel the distance, a conclusion seemingly at odds with special relativity. This is known as the EPR paradox. However, such correlations can never be used to transmit any information faster than the speed of light, a statement encapsulated in the no-communication theorem. Thus, teleportation as a whole can never be superluminal, as a qubit cannot be reconstructed until the accompanying classical information arrives.\n",
      "The sender will combine the particle, whose information is teleported, with one of the entangled particles, causing a change of the overall entangled quantum state. Of this changed state, the particles in the receiver's possession are then sent to an analyzer that will measure the change of the entangled state. The \"change\" measurement will allow the receiver to recreate the original information that the sender had, resulting in the information being teleported or carried between two people that have different locations. Since the initial quantum information is \"destroyed\" as it becomes part of the entangled state, the no-cloning theorem is maintained as the information is recreated from the entangled state and not copied during teleportation.\n",
      "The quantum channel is the communication mechanism that is used for all quantum information transmission and is the channel used for teleportation (relationship of quantum channel to traditional communication channel is akin to the qubit being the quantum analog of the classical bit). However, in addition to the quantum channel, a traditional channel must also be used to accompany a qubit to \"preserve\" the quantum information. When the change measurement between the original qubit and the entangled particle is made, the measurement result must be carried by a traditional channel so that the quantum information can be reconstructed and the receiver can get the original information. Because of this need for the traditional channel, the speed of teleportation can be no faster than the speed of light (hence the no-communication theorem is not violated). The main advantage with this is that Bell states can be shared using photons from lasers, making teleportation achievable through open space, as there is no need to send information through physical cables or optical fibers.\n",
      "Quantum states can be encoded in various degrees of freedom of atoms. For example, qubits can be encoded in the degrees of freedom of electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus or in the degrees of freedom of the nucleus itself. Thus, performing this kind of teleportation requires a stock of atoms at the receiving site, available for having qubits imprinted on them.\n",
      "As of 2015, the quantum states of single photons, photon modes, single atoms, atomic ensembles, defect centers in solids, single electrons, and superconducting circuits have been employed as information bearers.\n",
      "Understanding quantum teleportation requires a good grounding in finite-dimensional linear algebra, Hilbert spaces and projection matrices. A qubit is described using a two-dimensional complex number-valued vector space (a Hilbert space), which are the primary basis for the formal manipulations given below. A working knowledge of quantum mechanics is not absolutely required to understand the mathematics of quantum teleportation, although without such acquaintance, the deeper meaning of the equations may remain quite mysterious.\n",

      "### Article Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Wikipedia Summary: \n",
      "Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment describes a family of thought experiments in quantum physics proposed by John Archibald Wheeler, with the most prominent among them appearing in 1978 and 1984. These experiments illustrate the central point of quantum theory: \"It is wrong to attribute a tangibility to the photon in all its travel from the point of entry to its last instant of flight.\"\n",
      "These experiments close a loophole in the traditional double-slit experiment demonstration that quantum behavior depends on the experimental arrangement. The experiment closes the loophole that a photon might adjust its behavior from particle to wave behavior or vice versa. By altering the apparatus after the photon is supposed to be in \"flight\", the loophole is closed. \n",
      "Cosmic versions of the delayed-choice experiment use photons emitted billions of years ago; the results are unchanged. The concept of delayed choice has been productive of many revealing experiments. New versions of the delayed choice concept use quantum effects to control the \"choices\", leading to the delayed-choice quantum eraser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concept\n",
      "Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment demonstrates that no particle-propagation model consistent with relativity explains quantum theory. Like the double-slit experiment, Wheeler's concept has two equivalent paths between a source and detector. Like the which-way versions of the double-slit, the experiment is run in two versions: one designed to detect wave interference and one designed to detect particles. The new ingredient in Wheeler's approach is a delayed-choice between these two experiments. The decision to measure wave interference or particle path is delayed until just before the detection. The goal is to ensure that any traveling particle or wave will have passed the area of two distinct paths in the quantum system before the choice of experiment is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosmic interferometer\n",
      "Wheeler's cosmic scale thought experiment employs a quasar or other light source in a galaxy billions of light years away. Some of these stars are known to be located behind a massive galaxy that acts as a gravitational lens, bending light rays pointing away from Earth back towards us. The result is two images of the star, one direct and one bent. Wheeler proposed to measure the interference between these two paths. Because the light observed in such an experiment was emitted and passed through the lens billions of years ago, no choice on Earth could alter the outcome of the experiment. \n",
      "Wheeler then plays the devil's advocate and suggests that perhaps for those experimental results to be obtained would mean that at the instant astronomers inserted their beam-splitter, photons that had left the quasar some millions of years ago retroactively decided to travel as waves, and that when the astronomers decided to pull their beam splitter out again that decision was telegraphed back through time to photons that were leaving some millions of years plus some minutes in the past, so that photons retroactively decided to travel as particles.\n",
      "Several ways of implementing Wheeler's basic idea have been made into real experiments and they support the conclusion that Wheeler anticipated — that what is done at the exit port of the experimental device before the photon is detected will determine whether it displays interference phenomena or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Double-slit version\n",
      "A second kind of experiment resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment shows that a lens on the far side of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation of experimental results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.\n",
      "The retrocausal explanation, which Wheeler does not accept, says that with the detection screen in place, interference must be manifested. For interference to be manifested, a light wave must have emerged from each of the two slits. Therefore, a single photon upon coming into the double-slit diaphragm must have \"decided\" that it needs to go through both slits to be able to interfere with itself on the detection screen. For no interference to be manifested, a single photon coming into the double-slit diaphragm must have \"decided\" to go by only one slit because that would make it show up at the camera in the appropriate single telescope.\n",
      "In this thought experiment the telescopes are always present, but the experiment can start with the detection screen being present but then being removed just after the photon leaves the double-slit diaphragm, or the experiment can start with the detection screen being absent and then being inserted just after the photon leaves the diaphragm. Some theorists argue that inserting or removing the screen in the midst of the experiment can force a photon to retroactively decide to go through the double-slits as a particle when it had previously transited it as a wave, or vice versa. Wheeler does not accept this interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The double slit experiment, like the other six idealized experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we have found a way to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, \"...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bohmian interpretation\n",
      "In Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics, the particle obeys classical mechanics except that its movement takes place under the additional influence of its quantum potential. A neutron for example has a definite trajectory and passes through one or the other of the two slits and not both, just as it is in the case of a classical particle. However the quantum particle in Bohm's interpretation is inseparable from its associated field. That field provides the quantum properties. In the delayed choice experiment, wave packets associated with the field propagate along both paths of the interferometer, but only one packet contains a particle. The field aspect of the neutron is responsible for the interference between the two paths. Changing the final setup at the detector to look for particle properties amounts to ignoring the field aspect of the neutron.\n",
      "The past is determined and stays what it was up to the moment T1 when the experimental configuration for detecting it as a wave was changed to that of detecting a particle at the arrival time T2. At T1, when the experimental set up was changed, Bohm's quantum potential changes as needed, and the particle moves classically under the new quantum potential till T2 when it is detected as a particle. Thus Bohmian mechanics restores the conventional view of the world and its past. The past is out there as an objective history unalterable retroactively by delayed choice. The quantum potential contains information about the boundary conditions defining the system, and hence any change of the experimental set up is reflected in changes in the quantum potential which determines the dynamics of the particle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experimental details\n",
      "John Wheeler's original discussion of the possibility of a delayed choice quantum appeared in an essay entitled \"Law Without Law,\" which was published in a book he and Wojciech Hubert Zurek edited called Quantum Theory and Measurement, pp 182–213. He introduced his remarks by reprising the argument between Albert Einstein, who wanted a comprehensible reality, and Niels Bohr, who thought that Einstein's concept of reality was too restricted. Wheeler indicates that Einstein and Bohr explored the consequences of the laboratory experiment that will be discussed below, one in which light can find its way from one corner of a rectangular array of semi-silvered and fully silvered mirrors to the other corner, and then can be made to reveal itself not only as having gone halfway around the perimeter by a single path and then exited, but also as having gone both ways around the perimeter and then to have \"made a choice\" as to whether\n"
