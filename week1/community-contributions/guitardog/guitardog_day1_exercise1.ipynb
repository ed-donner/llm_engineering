       "\"Thank you for providing your schedule and goals. Here's a 4-month plan to prepare you for the Buffalo Marathon, balancing your work (9-5), swimming twice weekly, and reaching approximately 40 miles of running per week.\\n\\n**Overall goal for the week:**  \\nGradually build endurance and mileage, incorporating speed and recovery work, while fitting your swimming sessions to enhance cross-training without overloading your schedule.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weekly Structure Overview:\\n- **Run:** ~40 miles/week, split into 4-5 days with a mix of easy, steady, and long runs.\\n- **Swim:** Twice a week, on days with suitable pool availability.\\n- **Rest/Recovery:** 1 day per week.\\n- **Cross-training:** Optional gym at home or office for core, strength, and flexibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sample Weekly Schedule:\\n\\n**Week 1-4 (Base Building)**\\n- **Monday:** Rest day.\\n- **Tuesday:** Easy run 6-8 miles + optional core/strength training at home.\\n- **Wednesday:** Swim (preferably at Blodgett or MAC; aim for a 45-60 min session focusing on drills and effort).\\n- **Thursday:** Tempo run (8-10 miles including 4-6 miles at marathon pace).\\n- **Friday:** Easy/recovery run 4-6 miles.\\n- **Saturday:** Long run starting at 12-14 miles, increase by 1-2 miles weekly.\\n- **Sunday:** Swim (easy recovery swim, 30-45 min).\\n\\n**Pool options:**  \\n- **Wednesday:** Blodgett Pool or MAC during open hours (see schedule for availability).  \\n- **Sunday:** MAC Pool during available hours.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Week 5-8 (Building Intensity & Mileage)**\\n- Increase long runs to 16-20 miles gradually.\\n- Include intervals (e.g., 4x1 mile at faster pace) during midweek runs.\\n- Swim sessions remain, focusing on endurance and active recovery.\\n- Maintain 4-5 runs per week, adjusting for fatigue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Week 9-12 (Peak Training)**\\n- Long runs peak at 20-22 miles.\\n- Incorporate marathon pace segments into your long runs.\\n- Continue swimming for active recovery and injury prevention.\\n- Taper begins in week 13.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Notes:\\n- **Pool accessibility:**  \\n  - Swimming on Wednesdays and Sundays aligns well with available times. Use Blodgett Pool during the day and MAC Pool in the evenings or weekends as per schedule.\\n- **Travel time:**  \\n  - Since the pool is 4 miles away, plan to leave early or stay later to maximize your swimming sessions.\\n- **Flexibility:**  \\n  - Weekends are ideal for longer runs, utilizing your available pool hours for recovery swims.\\n- **Cross-training:**  \\n  - Use gym sessions for strength, especially core stability, which is crucial for marathon endurance.\\n\\n### Rest Day:\\n- **Monday** each week will be dedicated to rest and recovery.\\n- Use this day for stretching, foam rolling, or light yoga at home or office.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Progress Monitoring:\\n- Every 3-4 weeks, assess your progress with a half marathon or a simulated long run.\\n- Adjust mileage as needed based on fatigue and recovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\nStay consistent, hydrate well, and listen to your body. You're set for a solid marathon training cycle!\""
