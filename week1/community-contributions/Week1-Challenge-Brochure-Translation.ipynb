      "Dick Patrick - Vice Chairman and Partner Monumental Sports & Entertainment; and Chairman, Washington Capitals\n",
      "Dick Patrick has been part of the Washington Capitals organization since 1982 and was one of Ted Leonsis’s original partners when Monumental Sports & Entertainment was formed in June 2010. Mr. Patrick is Chairman of the Capitals and Vice Chairman of Monumental Sports & Entertainment. For the first five years of MSE’s existence, Mr. Patrick also assumed initial responsibility as Chief Operating Officer and was involved in all facets of operating three professional sports franchises – the Capitals, Washington Wizards and the Washington Mystics – and Capital One Arena.\n",
      "For four generations the family name of Patrick has been synonymous with the sport of hockey and the National Hockey League. Mr. Patrick’s grandfather, Lester Patrick, was the longtime coach and general manager of the New York Rangers. In his honor, the Lester Patrick Trophy is awarded annually for “outstanding service to hockey in the United States.” It was Lester who instilled in his family the desire to remain active in the advancement of the sport of hockey and the National Hockey League. Mr. Patrick’s father, Muzz, and uncle, Lynn, both played on the 1940 New York Rangers team that captured the Stanley Cup. In October 2012, Dick Patrick was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for his contributions to hockey in the United States. Mr. Patrick and his son, Chris, who is the Capitals associate general manager, became the sixth and seventh members of the Patrick family to win the Stanley Cup in 2018, a tradition that goes back 100 years in their legendary family.\n",
      "Read More\n",
      "Mr. Patrick’s cousin, Craig Patrick, played for the Capitals from 1977-79. He won two Stanley Cups as general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins and was enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame in November 2001 in the “builder” category.\n",
      "Before Mr. Patrick’s arrival, the Capitals had never advanced to postseason play. In his 40 seasons with the club, Washington has qualified for the playoffs 32 times – including the team’s Stanley Cup championship in 2018, the run to the Stanley Cup Final in 1998 and three Presidents’ Trophy-winning teams (2009-10, 2015-16, 2016-17). Since the 1982-83 season, the Capitals have compiled a record of 1,616-1,155-201-185 (.573 point percentage) and have recorded the second-most wins in the NHL in that span.\n",
      "During the 2010s, the Capitals (465-232-0-90) recorded the most wins of any team and only trailed the Montreal Canadiens of the 1970s (501-160-130-0) and the Boston Bruins of the 1970s (487-190-111-0) as the winningest franchise of any decade. Additionally, with a .648 point percentage, the Capitals only trailed the 1970 Canadiens and Bruins (Montreal: .712; Boston: .689) and the 2000s Detroit Red Wings (.682) for the highest point percentage in a single decade.\n",
      "Born in 1946 in Victoria, B.C., Mr. Patrick grew up in the United States. He earned his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College and a law degree from the Washington College of Law at American University. While raising children who have skated within local youth hockey programs, he has been instrumental in increasing the Capitals’ involvement in youth programs throughout the area.\n",
      "Brian MacLellan - President of Hockey Operations\n",
      "The 2024-25 season will mark Brian MacLellan’s 24th with the Capitals and his second as president of hockey operations. MacLellan, who served as general manager from 2014-15 to 2023-24, oversees and is responsible for all aspects of Washington’s hockey operations.\n",
      "During MacLellan's tenure as general manager, the Capitals won their first Stanley Cup (2018), two Presidents' Trophies (2016, 2017) and a franchise-record five consecutive Metropolitan Division titles from 2015-16 to 2019-20. The Capitals compiled a record of 449-244-88 (.631 point percentage) in MacLellan’s 10 years as GM, the third-most wins in the NHL in that span. In addition, the Capitals reached the 100-point mark six times with MacLellan at the helm and were on pace for 100-plus points in the shortened 2019-20 season and abbreviated 2020-21 season. MacLellan finished his run as general manager with the third-highest point percentage in NHL history among GMs with at least 500 games of experience, trailing only Sam Pollock (Montreal Canadiens, 1964-1978: .685) and Don Sweeney (Boston Bruins, 2015-present: .665). MacLellan, 65, was named the sixth general manager in the franchise’s history on May 26, 2014 after previously serving as the team’s assistant general manager, director of player personnel and as a professional scout.\n",
      "Of the 19 players to take the ice during the Capitals’ Cup-clinching win in Game 5 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Final, eight were either signed, traded for, or drafted by MacLellan, including three of the four players that scored in the game (Jakub Vrana, Devante Smith- Pelly and Lars Eller). The Capitals tied an NHL record with 10 road wins during the run and joined the 1991 Pittsburgh Penguins as the only teams to win the Stanley Cup despite trailing in all four series.\n",
      "Read More\n",
      "The Capitals won their second-straight Presidents’ Trophy in 2016-17, marking the seventh time in NHL history that a team has won the Presidents’ Trophy in consecutive seasons. Washington posted a 55-19-8 record, marking the second-most wins and third-most points (118) in a season in franchise history. The Capitals recorded 55 wins in two straight seasons (2015-16: 56, 2016-17: 55), joining the Montreal Canadiens (1975-78) as the only teams in NHL history to win 55 or more games in consecutive seasons.\n",
      "In 2015-16, Washington led the NHL with a record of 56-18-8 (120 points) and captured its second Presidents’ Trophy in franchise history (2009-10). The Capitals set franchise records in wins and road wins (27), and MacLellan was named a finalist for the 2015-16 NHL General Manager of the Year Award.\n",
      "In his first season, Washington posted a record of 45-26-11 (101 points), reaching the 100-point mark for the eighth time in team history and the first since the 2010-11 season.\n",
      "As assistant general manager and director of player personnel, MacLellan oversaw the club’s professional scouting staff and worked closely with the team’s American Hockey League affiliate, the Hershey Bears, who won the Calder Cup in 2006, 2009 and 2010. MacLellan, who served as a pro scout for the Capitals from 2000-03 prior to his promotion to director of player personnel, assisted and advised the general manager in all player-related matters.\n",
      "MacLellan, who won a Stanley Cup with the Calgary Flames in 1989, recorded 413 points (172 goals, 241 assists) in 606 games during his 10-year NHL career with the Los Angeles Kings, New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars, Calgary Flames and Detroit Red Wings. MacLellan also won a silver medal with Team Canada at the 1985 World Championship in Prague.\n",
      "The Guelph, Ont., native played hockey at Bowling Green State University from 1978-82, registering 143 points (64g, 79a) in 160 games. MacLellan’s 345 career penalty minutes rank sixth in school history. The 6’3” forward earned 63 points his freshman year, marking the second most points by a freshman in school history. MacLellan moved to defense in his junior season and was named an All-American defenseman and First-Team All-CCHA in 1982. MacLellan served as co-captain for the Falcons from 1980-82. He was elected to the Bowling Green Athletic Hall of Fame in 1987.\n",
      "MacLellan graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration from Bowling Green and earned his MBA in finance from the University of St. Thomas in 1995. He went on to work for an investment consulting firm in Minneapolis before joining the Capitals as a pro scout.\n",
      "Chris Patrick - Senior Vice President & General Manager\n",
      "Chris Patrick was named the seventh general manger in franchise history on July 8, 2024. Patrick, 48, recently completed his 16th season with the club and first as associate general manager.
