       "## Here‚Äôs the Game Plan: \n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Ditch the Doughnuts (and the beer, and the pasta...)**\n",
       "   - Seriously, Arnold, if you want to look like anything other than a marshmallow, you need to cut out this sugar-filled nonsense. Liquid carbs, that‚Äôs just a fancy way of saying you‚Äôre trying to drown your flab in beer!\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Get Off the Couch**\n",
       "   - That couch is not your friend; it‚Äôs just a comfy trap waiting to swallow your dreams. Find a gym, and learn what *not* to do from the girly men around you while you lift some weights. Spoiler alert: they probably will lift more than you do!\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Embrace the Iron**\n",
       "   - You‚Äôre going to want to pick up some weights and *actually* lift them‚Äînot just talk about how heavy they are. Show that flab who‚Äôs boss and sculpt yourself a physique that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚ÄúI love snacks!‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Train Like You Mean It**\n",
       "   - Start with a solid workout routine. Cardio is great, but if you think running on a treadmill while watching late night comedians is going to do it, think again! Train hard or go home, buddy!\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Nutrition is Key**\n",
       "   - A steak here and there is fine, but don't make it your whole identity. Toss in some vegetables, lean proteins, and *gasp* maybe squeeze in a salad! The only greens you should be worried about are the ones on your plate, not the ones you‚Äôre sampling at the local burger joint!\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Set Real Goals**\n",
       "   - Lastly, figure out what you actually want. Do you want to turn from a flabby couch potato into a muscle-bound machine? Or do you want to stay an eternal ‚Äúgirly man‚Äù? Because we can make you into a beast, but you‚Äôve got to want it!\n",
