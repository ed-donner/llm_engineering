      "Transfer learning improves the performance of deep neural networks in domains with limited labeled data by leveraging knowledge gained from pretrained models on larger, related datasets. Here’s how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pretraining**: A deep learning model is first trained on a large dataset (often on a general task). During this phase, the model learns to capture general features and representations from the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feature Extraction**: The pretrained model can serve as a feature extractor. When applied to a new task with limited labeled data, the model can utilize the learned features rather than starting from scratch. This allows it to make better predictions even when the new dataset is small.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fine-tuning**: The pretrained model can be further fine-tuned on the new dataset. This involves training the model for a few more epochs on the limited data, allowing it to adjust its weights while still retaining the knowledge from the original training. Fine-tuning helps the model adapt to specific characteristics of the new task.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Reduced Overfitting**: By starting with a model that has already learned relevant features, transfer learning can reduce the risk of overfitting common in scenarios with limited data. The model's complexity is tempered by the pretrained weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Faster Training**: Since the model has already learned significant patterns, transfer learning often leads to faster convergence during training, allowing for quicker model iteration and deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, transfer learning allows models to leverage existing knowledge from larger datasets to improve learning efficiency and accuracy in new tasks with scarce labeled data, resulting in better performance overall.\n"

      "* **Capturing domain-agnostic features**: The pre-trained model has already learned general features that are applicable across multiple tasks, reducing the need for a large target dataset.\n",
      "* **Focusing on task-specific knowledge**: Fine-tuning enables the model to focus on acquiring task-specific knowledge from the limited target data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some popular techniques used in transfer learning include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Domain adaptation**: Adapting pre-trained models to new domains by adjusting the model's weights and regularization parameters.\n",
      "* **Feature extraction**: Using pre-trained models as feature extractors for downstream tasks, where the goal is not to fine-tune the entire model but rather to utilize its learned features.\n",
