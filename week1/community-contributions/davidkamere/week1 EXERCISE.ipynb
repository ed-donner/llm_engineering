       "**Short Answer**\n",
       "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is an architecture that combines retrieval models with text generation models to reduce hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). It uses a retrieval model to retrieve relevant documents from a database, which are then used as input for the generator model to generate coherent and accurate responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it Works**\n",
       "\n",
       "The RAG architecture consists of two main components:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Retrieval Model**: A specialized model that takes in user queries and retrieves relevant documents from a database.\n",
       "2. **Generator Model**: A large language model that generates text based on the retrieved documents.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an overview of how RAG works:\n",
       "\n",
       "* The user submits a query to the retrieval model, which searches for relevant documents in the database.\n",
       "* The retrieval model returns a list of top-ranked documents that are most relevant to the query.\n",
       "* The generator model takes the top-ranked documents as input and generates text based on their content.\n",
       "* The final output is a coherent and accurate response that combines the best parts of each document.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example**\n",
       "\n",
       "Suppose we want to build an RAG-based chatbot for customer support. We have a database of articles related to common customer inquiries, such as \"how do I reset my password?\" or \"what are the return policies for defective products?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "When a user submits a query like \"I forgot my password and it's not showing up on my account page\", the retrieval model searches for relevant documents in the database and returns a list of top-ranked articles. The generator model takes these articles as input and generates a response that combines the best parts of each article, such as \"You can try resetting your password by following these steps: [insert steps from retrieved articles].\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**Common Mistakes**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Ignoring the retrieval model**: Many RAG implementations neglect to include or underestimate the importance of the retrieval model. This can lead to poor performance and hallucinations.\n",
       "* **Over-reliance on generator model**: If the generator model is not properly fine-tuned, it may produce inaccurate or irrelevant responses even with a good retrieval model.\n",
       "* **Insufficient training data**: RAG requires large amounts of high-quality training data to ensure effective retrieval and generation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Analogy**\n",
       "\n",
       "Think of RAG as a librarian and an author. The librarian (retrieval model) searches for relevant books (documents) in the library's catalog. The author (generator model) takes these books as input and writes a coherent and accurate book summary or chapter based on their content. By combining the strengths of both, RAG produces more accurate and informative responses than a plain LLM chatbot alone."
