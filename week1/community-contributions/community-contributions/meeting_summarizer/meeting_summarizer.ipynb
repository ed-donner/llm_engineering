      "Neha: I checked the infrastructure metrics. CPU and memory look fine, but the database connection pool is getting exhausted.\n",
      "Amit: From QA side, we noticed this happens when multiple users place orders simultaneously during load testing.\n",
      "Swati: So the issue seems related to high concurrency. Rahul, why is the connection pool getting exhausted?\n",
      "Rahul: The service is opening new DB connections but not closing them properly in one error-handling scenario.\n",
      "Neha: That explains why connections keep increasing until the pool limit is reached.\n",
      "Swati: So the root cause is improper connection handling in the Order Service code.\n",
      "Amit: Yes, once the pool is exhausted, requests start failing, which matches what we observed.\n",
      "Swati: Alright, solution-wise, Rahul can you fix the connection closing logic and add safeguards?\n",
      "Rahul: Yes, I'll update the code to ensure connections are closed in all scenarios and add monitoring logs.\n",
      "Neha: I’ll also adjust alerts to notify us earlier if connection usage spikes.\n",
      "Swati: Great. Rahul will own the code fix, Neha will handle monitoring updates. Let’s target a fix by tomorrow.\n",
