    "AI Website Intelligence for Competitor Monitoring is a system that automatically analyzes competitor websites and extracts structured, actionable insights using AI. Instead of manually reviewing websites, marketing pages, and product updates, this tool helps teams continuously monitor competitors and understand how they position their products, pricing, and value propositions.\n",
