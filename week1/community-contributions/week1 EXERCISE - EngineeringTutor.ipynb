    "# End of week 1 exercise\n",
    "Computer Engineering Tutor. User can ask the question and it answer assuming the user has some engineering background.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample computer-science questions (copy into the prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try one of these example questions to get started. They are tailored to computer science and software engineering topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain Big O notation and give examples for common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).\n",
    "- How does a hash table handle collisions and what are common collision-resolution strategies?\n",
    "- What's the difference between processes and threads, and when should you use each?\n",
    "- How does TCP differ from UDP, and in which scenarios would you choose one over the other?\n",
    "- Explain ACID vs BASE in databases and when each consistency model is appropriate.\n",
    "- What is a race condition and how can you prevent it in concurrent programs?\n",
    "- How does an LRU cache work and where would you use it?\n",
    "- Describe the compilation pipeline from source code to machine code (lexing, parsing, optimization, codegen).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup & requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates using both the OpenAI API and a local Ollama server to answer technical questions. Before running the notebook, make sure you complete the following setup steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Python environment and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    " - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).\n",
    " - Install the project dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Create a `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    " - In the repository root create a file named `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-<your-openai-key>\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Optionally you can add an Ollama API key variable if you use one (not required for the default local Ollama setup):\n",
    "```text\n",
    "OLLAMA_API_KEY=ollama\n",
    "```\n",
    " - This notebook reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment. If you choose to use `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, adjust the client instantiation accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Install and run Ollama (local LLM server)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Install Ollama following their official instructions for your OS (macOS, Linux, Windows).\n",
    " - Start the Ollama server so it is reachable on `localhost:11434`. For many installations the server listens on port `11434` by default.\n",
    "   - Example (if using the Ollama CLI): run the Ollama service so the API is available at `http://localhost:11434`.\n",
    " - If you change the port or host, update the `base_url` used for the Ollama client in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Quick verification (once Ollama is running)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Check the daemon is reachable:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -I http://localhost:11434/\n",
    "```\n",
    " - List available models (use the exact model id reported here in the notebook):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models | jq .\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Example model id you may see: `llama3.2:1b`. Use that exact id when calling the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Notebook client configuration notes\n",
    "\n",
    " - The notebook uses the OpenAI-compatible Python client. For Ollama the notebook sets the client like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ollama = OpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:11434/v1\", api_key=\"ollama\")\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Important: For the OpenAI client installed in this environment the `base_url` must include the `/v1` suffix so requests go to `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`. If you get a 404 error, check whether the client is calling a path without `/v1` and adjust `base_url` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Running the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    " - After completing steps above, run the cells from top to bottom.\n",
    " - If you get errors, first try non-streaming calls to check basic connectivity:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ask_llm(ollama, \"Say hi\", MODEL_LLAMA, stream=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    " - If non-streaming works but streaming fails, the streaming loop may need to be adjusted to match the chunk format returned by your OpenAI client version; the notebook contains defensive streaming handling to help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where to find diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    " - A diagnostic code cell follows the environment setup; run it to print the OpenAI package version, the Ollama `/v1/models` response, and a quick non-streaming test reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Troubleshooting tips\n",
    "\n",
    " - `Connection refused` or no response: Ollama daemon is not running or wrong port.\n",
    " - `404 page not found`: incorrect base_url or missing `/v1` in requests.\n",
    " - `model not found`: use the exact model id reported by `/v1/models` (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`).\n",
    " - `401/403`: authentication mismatch — either remove the auth header for a local server that doesn't require it or set the correct token."

       "1. **Lexing**: This is the initial stage where the compiler reads the raw source code and breaks it down into tokens. Tokens are the basic building blocks like keywords, operators, and identifiers. The lexer eliminates white spaces and comments, producing a stream of tokens for further processing.\n",
       "\n",

It verifies that the sequence of tokens adheres to the rules of the language and captures the hierarchical structure of the program. Any syntax errors are identified during this phase.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Optimization and Code Generation**: After parsing, the compiler may optimize the syntax tree or intermediate representation to improve performance, reduce resource consumption, or enhance execution speed. Finally, the code generation phase translates this optimized representation into machine code, producing an object file or executable that the processor can execute.\n",
