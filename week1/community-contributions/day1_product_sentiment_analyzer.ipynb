Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

His friends, tired of being held hostage by his LLM lectures, successfully weaponized his chatter into best-selling courses.\\n\\n**The Vibe:** A cozy corner of the internet for anyone who enjoys nodding sagely at Hacker News articles they only half understand, while dabbling in \"very amateur\" electronic music.\\n\\n**What\\'s On Offer:**\\n*   **AI Curriculum:** Presumably where you go to learn how to make the machines do your bidding.\\n*   **Proficient AI Engineer:** For when you\\'re done being a novice.\\n*   **Connect Four & Outsmart:** Because even AI gurus need to play games. \"Outsmart\" is described as an LLM thunderdome, which sounds significantly more fun than most corporate meetings.\\n\\n**Latest News & Ed\\'s Musings:**\\n*   **Feb 2026:** He\\'s already talking about 2026, teaching us how to evolve from a \"Vibe Coder\" to an \"Agentic Engineer.\" (Buzzword compliance: high.)\\n*   **Jan 2026:** Building AI agents with n8n.

Just be prepared to give him your email address. He promises to only \"occasionally\" contact you and \"add value,\" which in internet-speak means you\\'ll probably get a newsletter.'"
