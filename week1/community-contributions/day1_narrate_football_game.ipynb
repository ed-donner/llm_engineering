This match was filled with drama and crucial moments that kept fans on the edge of their seats.\n\n### First Half Highlights\n\nThe game kicked off with both teams striving for early dominance. It didn’t take long for Cagliari to make their mark, as they opened the scoring in just the 6th minute. **Roberto Piccoli** found the back of the net, sending the home crowd into a frenzy; Cagliari led 1-0 early.\n\nHowever, Fiorentina responded with great intensity. After some exchanges, they found an equalizer in the 35th minute through **Robin Gosens**, who struck to level the game at 1-1. The first half concluded with both teams at a stalemate, but Fiorentina carried a slight advantage in possession and shots on target.\n\n### Second Half Thrills\n\nAs the second half commenced, Fiorentina took control, creating more opportunities. Their efforts paid off just two minutes after the break when **Lucas Beltrán** scored in the 47th minute, putting Fiorentina ahead 2-1. This goal shifted the momentum firmly in favor of the visitors.\n\nCagliari attempted to regroup, making substitutions and pushing forward to find an equalizer. They had some chances but struggled to fully penetrate Fiorentina's defense. The home side managed to compile a total of 8 shots but could only register 2 on target, while Fiorentina matched their shots but managed a more clinical performance with 4 on target.\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **Goals:**  \n  - Cagliari: 1  \n  - Fiorentina: 2  \n\n- **Expected Goals (xG):**  \n  - Cagliari: 0.37  \n  - Fiorentina: 0.70  \n\n- **Shots:**  \n  - Cagliari: 8  \n  - Fiorentina: 8  \n\n- **Shots on Target:**  \n  - Cagliari: 2  \n  - Fiorentina: 4  \n\n- **Possession and Pressure:**  \n  - Cagliari had a PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action) of 12.41, while Fiorentina managed a tighter 11.89. This suggests that Fiorentina was more effective in breaking down Cagliari's defensive structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, the match concluded with Fiorentina taking all three points with a determined display. Despite a valiant effort from Cagliari, their inability to capitalize on chances proved costly. With xPTS (expected points) showing a reflective scoreline, Cagliari's final total fell short of their expectations at 0.93, while Fiorentina exceeded their xPTS with a solid 1.63.\n\nIt was a match marked by tactical battles, and while Cagliari may feel disappointed, Fiorentina celebrated a crucial win that could boost their ambitions for the remainder of the season."
