    "\n",
    "Dear Shashwat,\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you are doing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following our discussion earlier this week, I wanted to formally document where we stand on the project scope, highlight the constraints we are currently facing, and propose a path forward that minimizes delivery risk while preserving the original business intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Current Status and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today, Phase 2 development is approximately 65% complete, with the core architecture stabilized. However, two material issues have emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Delays: The upstream API changes from the vendor were delivered 12 days later than originally committed, compressing our integration window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope Expansion: The additional reporting requirements introduced in the last review meeting were not part of the original functional specification and require non-trivial backend restructuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the team has absorbed part of this impact through parallelization, continuing under the existing timeline would significantly increase the likelihood of regressions and post-release defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Impact Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "If we proceed without adjustment:\n",
    "\n",
    "QA coverage will be reduced by ~30%\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical debt will increase, particularly around data validation and edge-case handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-launch stabilization effort is likely to exceed initial estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "From a long-term ownership and maintenance perspective, this is not an outcome I would recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Proposed Options\n",
    "\n",
    "To move forward constructively, I see three viable options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Option A – Timeline Extension (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend Phase 2 delivery by 2 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain full test coverage and code quality standards\n",
    "\n",
    "No functional compromises\n",
    "\n",
    "Option B – Scope Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Defer advanced reporting features to Phase 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain original delivery date\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires formal sign-off on revised scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Option C – Parallel Release Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliver core functionality as planned\n",
    "\n",
    "Release reporting features in a follow-up patch\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher coordination overhead, moderate risk\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Recommendation and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation is Option A, as it best balances business value, system stability, and team sustainability. That said, I’m fully open to aligning with broader organizational priorities if speed is the overriding concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid further ambiguity, I suggest we:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm the preferred option by EOD Friday\n",
    "\n",
    "Lock scope changes after sign-off\n",
    "\n",
    "Update all stakeholders with a revised plan immediately thereafter\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let me know your thoughts, or if you’d like to walk through the trade-offs live. I’m happy to schedule a short working session to finalize this.\n",
