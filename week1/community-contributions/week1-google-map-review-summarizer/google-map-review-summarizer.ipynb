    "# üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps Review Summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python app automates the process of fetching and summarizing Google Maps reviews for any business or location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Overview\n",
    "The app performs two main tasks:\n",
    "1. **Scrape Reviews** ‚Äì Uses a web scraping script to extract reviews directly from Google Maps.\n",
    "2. **Summarize Content** ‚Äì Leverages OpenAI's language models to generate concise, insightful summaries of the collected reviews and analyse the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Tech Stack\n",
    "- **Python** ‚Äì Core language\n",
    "- **Playwright** ‚Äì For scraping reviews\n",
    "- **OpenAI API** ‚Äì For natural language summarization\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì For exploration, testing, and demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "### üôè Credits\n",
    "The web scraping logic is **inspired by [Antonello Zanini‚Äôs blog post](https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-google-reviews/)** on building a Google Reviews scraper. Special thanks for the valuable insights on **structuring and automating the scraping workflow**, which greatly informed the development of this improved scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This app, however, uses an **enhanced version of the scraper** that can scroll infinitely to load more reviews until it collects **at least 1,000 reviews**. If only a smaller number of reviews are available, the scraper stops scrolling earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Sample Output\n",
    "Here is a summary of reviews of a restuarant generated by the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](google-map-review-summary.jpg)\n",
    "\n",

    "**Note:** This project is intended for educational and research purposes. Please ensure compliance with Google‚Äôs [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) when scraping or using their data.\n"
