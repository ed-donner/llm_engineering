    "I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the airbrush product I purchased from your store. Unfortunately, the product I received is defective and does not meet the quality standards as advertised.\n",

    "Defective Nozzle: The nozzle of the airbrush is clogged and does not allow proper airflow, making it impossible to use.\n",

    "Inconsistent Spray Pattern: Even after multiple attempts to clean and adjust the settings, the spray pattern is uneven and inconsistent.\n",

    "Build Quality: The overall build quality of the product feels subpar, with loose fittings and a flimsy trigger mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Taken:\n",
    "I followed the user manual and cleaning instructions provided, but the issues persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also reached out to your technical support team on [Date] but have not received a resolution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Attachments:\n",
    "I have attached photos and a video demonstrating the issues for your reference.\n",
    "\n",
