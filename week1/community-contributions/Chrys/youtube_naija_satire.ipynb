        "# YouTube Naija Satire Generator\n",
        "\n",
        "This project scrapes the latest videos from a YouTube channel and generates satirical 'Naija' takes for each video using a local Ollama LLM or by using Openrouter models. The workflow is designed for local development and testing, with modular sections for scraping, prompt engineering, and LLM integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Outline\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Introduction & Motivation**\n",
        "   This notebook aims to blend the power of LLMs with Nigerian pop culture by generating witty, satirical takes on trending YouTube videos. The goal is to showcase how AI can be used for creative, culturally relevant content generation, and to provide a fun, hands-on example of prompt engineering and LLM integration for local development.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Environment Setup**\n",
        "   To run this notebook, ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install dependencies with `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` or directly in the notebook. You also need Ollama running locally (see https://ollama.com/ for installation instructions). Make sure to set up your .env file with any required API keys if you want to use OpenRouter or other APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **YouTube Channel Scraping**\n",
        "   The notebook uses the YouTube RSS feed to fetch the latest videos from a given channel ID. It extracts metadata such as title, description, and video URL for the most recent N videos. This approach avoids the need for YouTube API keys and is suitable for public channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prompt Engineering for Satire**\n",
        "   A custom prompt template is crafted to instruct the LLM to generate satirical, Naija-style commentary. The prompt encourages the use of Pidgin English, local references, and humor, while maintaining a respectful and analytical tone.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Local Ollama LLM Integration**\n",
        "   The notebook connects to a local Ollama server using the OpenAI-compatible API. Prompts are sent to the LLM, and responses are received in real time. This setup ensures privacy, speed, and flexibility to swap models as desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Satirical Take Generation**\n",
        "   For each video fetched, the notebook generates a satirical take using the LLM and displays the result alongside the video title and link. This demonstrates how LLMs can be used for batch content generation and creative applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **User Controls & Output Formatting**\n",
        "   Users can adjust parameters such as the number of videos to process, the channel ID, and the satire style by modifying variables in the notebook. Results are displayed in markdown for readability, with links to the original videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Testing & Evaluation**\n",
        "   The notebook can be run end-to-end with a sample channel to evaluate the quality and humor of the generated satire. Users are encouraged to experiment with different channels, prompt tweaks, and models to refine the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notes\n",
        "- All LLM calls are routed to a local Ollama instance for privacy and speed.\n",
        "- The notebook is modular: you can swap out the LLM or scraping logic as needed.\n",
        "- Add your code in the indicated sections to build out each part of the workflow.\n",
        "- For best results, use a modern LLM with good instruction-following and creative capabilities.\n",
        "- This project is for educational and entertainment purposes only; always respect content creators and avoid generating harmful or offensive outputs.\n"

              "### [Somaliland is ready to grant US access to minerals and bases](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JGX_s8s5wGM)\n",
              "Gist for you: Somaliland don yan the US compass, say make dem waka into minerals and bases - na real or na headline breeze? Here my Naija take, sharp, analytical and with small spice.\n",
              "\n",
              "- Minerals go turn to: US dey look for lithium, rare earths, gold, you name am. E no be only “minerals”, e be “power to run the world’s gadgets hole” vibes. If dem sign, na the global supply chain go shake pass as If dem just leak the battery for your phone and say “you’re welcome.” The question wey dey front: who go dey benefit for real, and how dem go protect di land from turning to big mining site with road signs saying “I go collect this brain for export”?\n",
              "\n",
              "- Bases matter: Bases no be for village people to hold tengue meetups. E mean logistics hubs, surveillance, and drone corridors. If US fit base Somaliland, na geopolitical chess we dey play: security umbrella for some regions, but also potential flashpoint for others wey dey look am like “why you dey park your tanks here?” Local communities go gaslight themselves as “development” or “resource extraction with a side of noise.”\n",
              "\n",
              "- Sovereignty and recognition: Somaliland no be fully recognised by many nations, so any deal with the US go require careful diplomatic wiring. E go resemble “we dey talk to Uncle Sam; but our house still under reconstruction.” For global politics, recognition levels fit determine how sweet or sour the arrangement go taste. Naija own sabi: wahala if agreement no clear-cut, we finish with more questions than answers.\n",
              "\n",
              "- Local impact: If minerals and bases come, e go bring roads, schools, or e go bring enviromental gbege wey turn nearby communities into the first test sites for “how to coexist with heavy machinery.” Naija fuller ground: the sweet talk of development must come with accountability, fair benefit sharing, and real community consent. No be only press release matter.\n",
              "\n",
              "- Nigeria angle wey dey pata: If this model work, people go dey ask, “how we fit replicate for our own resources?” But also dem go fear “debt-for-access” arrangements and sovereignty questions. The real win go be if resource wealth translate to real local development, not just another foreign-funded project wey vanish before elections.\n",
              "\n",
              "- Final gist: The video dey spicy and dramatic, but geopolitics na a big game with many players and few straight answers. If Somaliland and US pull this off, expect a track record of deals where the headlines look glamorous and the details require reading glasses. For now, e remain geopolitics dressed as mineral shopping – naija watch-and-see, with popcorn ready and sense on standby."

On top this, the Wake Up Conversations crew—Gbenga, Olive, and Joe—don talk say tech fit help us know who win, but e no dey solve trust if our oversight no strong.
