    "It starts by loading environment variables using dotenv, which pulls sensitive values like your API key from a .env file instead of hardcoding them. That’s good operational hygiene. The OPENAI_API_KEY is retrieved from the environment so it can be used securely elsewhere in your project.\n",

    "The headers dictionary defines a standard browser User-Agent string. Many websites block requests that look like bots, so pretending to be a regular browser increases the chance the request succeeds. It’s a small but practical trick.\n",

    "The core logic lives in fetch_website_contents(url). Here’s what it does:\n",

    "First, it sends an HTTP GET request to the provided URL using requests. Then it parses the returned HTML using BeautifulSoup, which turns messy markup into a structured tree you can navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It extracts the page title if it exists. After that, it focuses on the <body> section of the page and removes elements that don’t contribute meaningful readable content — specifically <script>, <style>, <img>, and <input> tags. This prevents JavaScript, CSS, and form elements from polluting the text output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it extracts the visible text from the cleaned body, separating elements with line breaks for readability. Finally, it combines the title and body text into a single string and truncates the result to 2,000 characters. That truncation is practical — especially if the content is later sent to an AI model with token limits."
