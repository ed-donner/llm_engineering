       "### 3️⃣ Overall Assessment\n",
       "- **What does this user specialize in?** Fikriraihan specializes in JavaScript and TypeScript, indicating a focus on web development or applications that utilize these languages.\n",
       "- **Are they more focused on personal projects or collaborations?** The presence of multiple repositories suggests a mix of personal projects. There is no indication of collaboration, as there are no mentions of contributions to external repositories.\n",
       "- **Any standout strengths or skills you notice?** The variety of repositories shows an interest in different coding challenges and portfolio projects. However, the lack of stars suggests that the projects may not yet attract a significant audience.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4️⃣ Recommendations\n",
       "- **Suggest one area or technology they could explore next to grow:** Given the user’s focus on JavaScript and TypeScript, exploring frameworks like React, Vue.js, or even server-side technologies such as Node.js could be beneficial.\n",
       "- **Suggest one improvement to make their GitHub profile more appealing:** Adding a bio with a brief introduction and interests, along with project descriptions, would provide more context about the user and enhance engagement with their repositories. Additionally, increasing the visibility of the repositories through more optimization and possibly sharing or collaborating on projects could attract more stars and followers."
