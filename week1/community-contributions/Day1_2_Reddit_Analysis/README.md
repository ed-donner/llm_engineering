## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Reddit API Credentials Setup

To access Reddit data, you need to create a Reddit app and obtain credentials:

#### Steps to Get Your Reddit API Keys:

1. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
2. Scroll to the bottom and click **‚Äúcreate another app‚Äù** or **‚Äúcreate app‚Äù**.
3. Choose the **‚Äúscript‚Äù** option.
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **name:** e.g., Reddit Analyzer  
   - **redirect uri:** `http://localhost:8080`  
   - **description:** *(optional)*
5. After creating the app, you will get:
   - **client ID** (displayed under the app name)
   - **client secret**
6. Keep note of your Reddit **username** and **password** (these are used with script apps)

#### Store your credentials in a `.env` file:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following format:

```env
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_custom_user_agent
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_reddit_password
```

These will be securely loaded into your script using the `dotenv` package.
