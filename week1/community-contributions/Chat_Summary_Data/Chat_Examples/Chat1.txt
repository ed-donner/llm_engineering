Client: Hello I would like to order a pizza
Restaurant: Sure. What pizza would you like to order from our menu?
Client: Chicken Ranch
Restaurant: I am so sorry, but chicken ranch is currently unavailable on our menu
Client: AHHHHH. Do you have chicken BBQ?
Restaurant: Yes! Do you want it small, medium, or large?
Client: Medium
Restaurant: Ok. This will be 180 LE
Client: Thanks
Restaurant: Anytime.
Client: AHHHH I forgot. I want to add a new chicken BBQ pizza
Restaurant: No problem. Do you also want it medium?
Client: Yes
Restaurant: Okay this will be 380 LE
Client: Okay Thanks
Client: Wait a minute. Isn't 180 * 2 = 360?
Restaurant: It seems that there might be a misunderstanding. We add an extra 20 LE for every extra pizza ordered.
Client: NOBODY TOLD ME THAT.. AND WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
Restaurant: We are sorry but this is our policy.
Client: Okay then I don't want your pizza.
Restaurant: We are so sorry to hear that. We can make a 10% discount on the total price so it would be 342 LE
Client: Fine
Restaurant: Thank you for ordering
Restaurant: Pizza is delivered. How is your experience?
Client: Your pizza doesn't taste good
Restaurant: We are so sorry to hear that. Do you have any suggestions you would like to make?
Client: Make good pizza
Restaurant: Thanks for your review. We will make sure to improve our pizza in the future. Your opinion really matters.
