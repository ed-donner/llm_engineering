Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

We’re applying AI to a field where it can make a massive, positive impact: helping people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being. I’m previously the founder and CEO of AI startup untapt,\\nacquired in 2021\\n.\\nI will happily drone on for hours about LLMs to anyone in my vicinity. My friends got fed up with my impromptu lectures, and convinced me to make some Udemy courses. To my total joy (and shock) they’ve become best-selling, top-rated courses, with 400,000 enrolled across 190 countries. The\\nfull curriculum is here\\n.
