This victory showcased the prowess of several players, particularly Kyle Kuzma, who delivered an outstanding performance.\n\n### Game Summary\nFrom the outset, the Bucks established a commanding presence. Milwaukee's offense was spearheaded by Kyle Kuzma, who delivered a breathtaking 31 points on an impressive 76.5% shooting. Additionally, Bobby Portis contributed significantly, adding 27 points with a stellar shooting performance, which kept the Celtics struggling to keep pace.\n\nBoston's Jaylen Brown did his best to rally his team, pouring in 30 points with decent efficiency, but the overall contribution from the Celtics' squad fell short. The Bucks held the momentum throughout the game, steadily building their lead and maintaining control over the pace of play.\n\n### Key Players\n- **Kyle Kuzma (MIL)**: The standout of the night, Kuzma not only scored prolifically but also contributed vital rebounds, collecting 6 boards. His efficient shooting and ability to find space allowed him to dominate on the offensive end.\n  \n- **Bobby Portis (MIL)**: Portis’s performance provided the necessary support for Kuzma, allowing the Bucks to stretch the lead and secure the victory. He was on fire from the field, showcasing his scoring ability with an 84.6% field goal rate.\n\n- **Jaylen Brown (BOS)**: Despite the loss, Brown's tenacity on offense kept the Celtics in the game for longer than they perhaps should have been. He shot 58.8% from the field, including hitting 8 of 9 free throws. However, he had minimal support from his teammates.\n\n### Celtics' Struggles\nThe Celtics struggled against the Bucks' defense and failed to find consistent scoring options. Players like Payton Pritchard and Derrick White had poor shooting nights, combining for only 22 points on dismal percentages. Their inability to make timely baskets compounded the energy the Bucks brought to Fiserv Forum.\n\n### Neemias Queta's Impact\nNeemias Queta had a quiet but impactful performance in his 25 minutes on the floor, finishing with 9 points and 10 rebounds. His presence in the paint provided Boston with a much-needed rebounding edge, as they totaled 39 rebounds, compared to Milwaukee's 40. However, despite his contributions, Queta struggled to create scoring opportunities for himself and was somewhat overshadowed by the scoring woes that plagued the Celtics.\n\nIn summary, the Bucks’ collective effort led to a convincing win against the Celtics, with Kuzma’s stellar performance front and center. The Celtics will need to regroup and find solutions, especially in terms of shooting efficiency, to bounce back after this defeat."
