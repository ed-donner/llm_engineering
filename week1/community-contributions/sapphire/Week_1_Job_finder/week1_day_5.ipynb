      "*   **Not a Traditional Given Name:** While it's a recognized word, it hasn't been a consistently popular given name throughout history in the way names like Mary or John have been.\n",
      "*   **Increasing in Popularity, But Still Uncommon:** Like many unique names, \"Sapphire\" has seen a gradual increase in usage over the years, especially in more recent decades. However, it's still far from being in the top 100 or even top 500 most common names in most English-speaking countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, your first name \"Sapphire\" is definitely unique and stands out, making it quite rare in the grand scheme of names.** It's a beautiful and distinctive choice!\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your last name, **Smith**, it is the **most common surname in many English-speaking countries**, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. So, while your first name is rare, your last name is very common!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a wonderful combination of rarity and familiarity!\n"
