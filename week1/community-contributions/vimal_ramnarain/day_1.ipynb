       "# Spaghetti alla Carbonara\n",
       "\n",
       "Spaghetti alla Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish that blends crisp guanciale or pancetta with a creamy, cheese-llecked egg sauce. Traditional carbonara relies on the heat of the freshly cooked pasta to gently cook the eggs and form a glossy emulsion with the cheese, creating a silky coating without cream. The dish centers on few ingredients—pasta, cured pork, eggs, and hard cheese—seasoned with black pepper. It’s quick to prepare, satisfying, and endlessly customizable with a good balance of salty, savory, and peppery notes.\n",

       "| Eggs | 4 large | traditional is 4 whole eggs (or 2 yolks + 2 whole eggs) |\n",
       "| Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese | 1 cup, finely grated | Pecorino Romano for authenticity if you have it |\n",
       "| Pancetta or guanciale | 4 oz (115 g), diced | guanciale is most authentic; pancetta also works well |\n",

       "Instructions\n",
       "Conventional cooking\n",
       "| Step | Instruction |\n",
       "|---|---|\n",
       "| 1 | Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta. |\n",
       "| 2 | In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper. |\n",
       "| 3 | In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta or guanciale until crisp. Remove from heat. |\n",
       "| 4 | Return the drained pasta to the pot. Add the crisp pancetta with its rendered fat and toss to coat the noodles. |\n",
       "| 5 | Off the heat, slowly pour in the egg–cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. Add small amounts of the reserved pasta water as needed to reach a silky emulsion. |\n",
       "| 6 | Season with additional pepper and, if desired, a little extra cheese. Serve immediately. |\n",
       "\n",
       "Air fryer cooking\n",
       "| Step | Instruction |\n",
       "|---|---|\n",
       "| 1 | Preheat the air fryer to 400°F (200°C). Place the diced pancetta or guanciale in the air fryer basket and cook 6–8 minutes until crisp. Carefully drain excess fat. |\n",
       "| 2 | In the meantime, boil a large pot of salted water and cook the spaghetti to al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain. |\n",
       "| 3 | In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated cheese, and pepper. |\n",
       "| 4 | In a large bowl, toss the hot spaghetti with the crisp pancetta and its rendered fat to coat. |\n",
       "| 5 | Off the heat, slowly add the egg–cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to emulsify with the pasta water until a creamy sauce forms. Add more pasta water a little at a time if needed to loosen the sauce. |\n",
       "| 6 | Optional: Transfer the sauced pasta to an oven-safe dish and place in the air fryer at 325°F (165°C) for 2–3 minutes to lightly set the sauce, then serve immediately. |\n",
       "\n",
       "Notes\n",
       "- The key to success is adding the egg mixture off the heat and using the residual heat of the pasta to gently cook the eggs. Do not hard-crack the eggs; you’re aiming for a silky, creamy sauce.\n",
       "- If you prefer a firmer bite on the pasta, cook it slightly longer; if you want a looser sauce, add a touch more pasta water.\n",
       "- For a more traditional flavor, use guanciale instead of pancetta and Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan.\n",
