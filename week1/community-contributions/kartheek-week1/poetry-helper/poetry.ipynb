It searches configured repositories for candidate versions and tries to find a combination that satisfies every dependency (including transitive ones).\n  - If multiple transitive constraints constrain the same package to incompatible versions, the solver will attempt to find a compatible combination. If no such combination exists, dependency resolution fails and you’ll see an resolution error.\n  - When constraints can be satisfied, Poetry selects a set of concrete versions that meet all constraints and proceeds to install them.\n\n- How this is reflected in poetry.lock\n  - After a successful resolution, Poetry writes the chosen exact versions to the poetry.lock file. The lock file records the specific versions that were installed (including transitive dependencies) so every environment uses the same set.\n  - If you later run poetry install with an existing lock file, Poetry installs the exact versions listed in poetry.lock, ensuring reproducible installs across environments.\n  - If you want to explore newer compatible versions, you can run poetry update, which re-solves dependencies and updates the lock file with the latest matching versions according to your pyproject.toml.\n  - Poetry also warns when the lock file is out of sync with pyproject.toml, indicating that the lock and metadata should be reconciled (e.g., by running install/update or regenerating the lock).\n\n- Note on multiple constraints\n  - Poetry supports multiple constraints for the same package (e.g., via multiple dependency entries or expanded constraint forms). The resolver must find a single set of versions that satisfies all of these constraints; otherwise, resolution fails. The lock will reflect the final resolved versions chosen by the solver."
