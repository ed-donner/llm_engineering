Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "'# Edward Donner\\'s Digital Den of AI Enthusiasm\\n\\nThis is the personal website of Ed Donner, a man who clearly loves AI more than most people love their pets. He\\'s a recovering CEO (sold his AI startup in 2021) and current CTO who has apparently bored his friends into submission with LLM lectures, forcing him to monetize his ramblings into best-selling Udemy courses.\\n\\n## The Vibe\\nThink: a humble-brag portfolio mixed with a newsletter signup funnel. He codes, he produces \"very amateur\" electronic music, and he nods sagely at Hacker News articles he doesn\\'t fully understand (joining 99% of that site\\'s readership).\\n\\n## What\\'s He Selling?\\n- **AI Courses:** 400,000 students can\\'t be wrong (or they\\'re all just as confused about AI as he pretends not to be)\\n- **AI Projects:** \"Connect Four\" and \"Outsmart\" - where LLMs battle it out in digital diplomacy (because what could go wrong?)\\n- **His Company:** Nebula.io, which uses AI to help people find their purpose (or at least find their next career move)\\n\\n## Recent \"News\" (From the Future?)\\nApparently Ed is living in 2026 while the rest of us are stuck in the present. His latest posts include:\\n- **Feb 2026:** \"AI Coder: Vibe Coder to Agentic Engineer\" (Because \"vibe coding\" is definitely a technical term)\\n- **Jan 2026:** \"AI Builder with n8n\" (Create agents and voice agents, presumably to take over when you\\'re tired of talking to yourself)\\n- **Nov 2025:** \"The Unique Energy of an AI Live Event\" (Read: people gathering to watch chatbots not hallucinate)\\n- **Sep 2025:** \"AI Engineering MLOps Track\" (For when you want to deploy AI to production and immediately regret it)\\n\\n## The Call to Action\\nThe entire site gently (and not-so-gently) nudges you to:\\n1. Take his courses\\n2. Sign up for his newsletter (\"I\\'ll only ever contact you occasionally\" - famous last words)\\n3. Marvel at how he\\'s teaching AI to hundreds of thousands while producing questionable electronic music\\n\\n**Bottom line:** If AI had a hype man, Ed would be it. His website is essentially a digital business card that says \"I talk about LLMs for a living, please give me your email address.\"'"

Either they've mastered AI time travel, someone forgot to update the placeholder dates, or we're all living in 2026 and nobody told me. The model promises to be \"the world's most powerful for coding, agents, and professional work.\" Because what professionals really need is an AI that's better at their jobs than they are.\n",

Use sites like **Trainline**, **Omio**, or the national rail operators' websites (Eurostar, SNCF, Deutsche Bahn).\n",
       "2.  **Book Trains Early:** Especially for the Eurostar and other high-speed trains (Thalys, ICE). Prices rise as the date approaches.\n",
       "3.  **Pack Light:** You'll be carrying your own bag on and off trains and through cities. A carry-on-sized suitcase or travel backpack is ideal.\n",
       "4.  **Accommodation:** Look for well-located hostels (great for meeting other travelers), boutique hotels, or guesthouses. Neighborhoods like the Marais in Paris, Kreuzberg in Berlin, or the Jordaan in Amsterdam are perfect for solo explorers.\n",
       "5.  **Connectivity:** Get a local EU SIM card or an eSIM for easy data access for maps and train schedules.\n",
