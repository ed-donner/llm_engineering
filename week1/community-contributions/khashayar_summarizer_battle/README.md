# 🥊 Summarization Battle: Ollama vs. OpenAI Judge

This mini-project pits multiple **local LLMs** (via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)) against each other in a **web summarization contest**, with an **OpenAI model** serving as the impartial judge.  
It automatically fetches web articles, summarizes them with several models, and evaluates the results on **coverage, faithfulness, clarity, and conciseness**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Fetch Articles** – Download and clean text content from given URLs.
- **Summarize with Ollama** – Run multiple local models (e.g., `llama3.2`, `phi3`, `deepseek-r1`) via the Ollama API.
- **Judge with OpenAI** – Use `gpt-4o-mini` (or any other OpenAI model) to score summaries.
- **Battle Results** – Collect JSON results with per-model scores, rationales, and winners.
- **Timeout Handling & Warmup** – Keeps models alive with `keep_alive` to avoid cold-start delays.

  "scores": {
    "llama3.2:latest": { "score": 4, "rationale": "Covers the main points..." },
    "deepseek-r1:1.5b": { "score": 3, "rationale": "Some inaccuracies..." },

## 💡 Ideas for Extension
- Add more Ollama models (e.g., `mistral`, `gemma`, etc.)
- Try different evaluation criteria (e.g., readability, length control)
- Visualize results with charts
- Benchmark runtime and token usage
