## Weather and wind speed information for wind energy producers.

### Objective

This project aims to extract and process meteorological information from the [Tempo.pt](https://www.tempo.pt/europa.htm) portal, with a special focus on wind conditions and weather forecasts relevant to wind power producers.

### Description

The `day1-exercise1.ipynb` file implements a web scraping system that:

- **Extracts meteorological data** from the tempo.pt website, specifically from the Europe forecast section
- **Collects information about wind conditions**, including speed and direction
- **Processes and structures** meteorological data in a useful format for analysis
- **Generates alerts and recommendations** for wind power producers based on forecasts

### Features

- Web scraping of weather forecasts from the Tempo.pt portal
- Extraction of specific data about wind conditions
- Analysis of weather conditions that may impact wind power production
- Generation of alerts about necessary precautions based on weather forecasts

### Target Audience

This project is especially useful for:
- **Wind power producers** who need to monitor wind conditions
- **Wind farm operators** who require up-to-date information about weather conditions
- **Renewable energy managers** interested in optimizing production based on weather forecasts

### Data Source

Data is extracted from the Portuguese meteorological portal [Tempo.pt - Europe](https://www.tempo.pt/europa.htm), which provides detailed forecasts about weather conditions for various European countries.
