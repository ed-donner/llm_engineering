              "\n",
              "1. **Set Comprehension**: The inner part `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` is creating a set. \n",
              "\n",
              "   - `book.get(\"author\")`: This is accessing the value associated with the key `\"author\"` for each `book` in the `books` iterable (which is likely a list or another collection of dictionaries).\n",
              "   - `if book.get(\"author\")`: This condition filters the books to only include those dictionaries that have a non-`None` value for the `\"author\"` key. If `book.get(\"author\")` returns `None` (or is otherwise falsy), that book will be excluded from the set.\n",
              "   - The use of curly braces `{}` indicates that we are creating a set. Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, so each author will only appear once in the resulting set.\n",
              "\n",
              "2. **Yield from**: The `yield from` statement is used in a generator function to yield all values from an iterable. In this case, it's yielding all the unique authors from the set we created in the previous step.\n",
