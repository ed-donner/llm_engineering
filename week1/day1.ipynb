Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

He’s the co-founder/CTO of **Nebula.io**, a company that’s basically trying to make recruiters cry with joy by using AI to find people who are *actually* passionate about their jobs (because, let’s be honest, most people are just there for the paycheck and the free coffee).\n",

They’ve got patents, awards, and a platform that’s basically a love letter to recruiters who finally get that \"happy customers\" is a real thing.\n",

       "\n",
       "And, of course, he’s got a blog full of **tech rants, AI musings, and the occasional DJ ramblings**—because nothing says \"amateur electronic music production\" like a guy who’s still figuring out how to sync beats and nod sagely at things he doesn’t understand.\n",

       "- **November 2025:** Edward’s been hosting AI live events, because nothing says \"community building\" like a bunch of people pretending to understand AI.\n",
       "- **September 2025:** Nebula’s diving into **Gen AI and Agentic AI on AWS at scale**, because if there’s one thing AI loves, it’s scaling things it doesn’t fully understand.\n",
       "- **May 2025:** They’ve got a **curriculum for AI engineers**, because even if you’re not a leader, you can at least pretend you know what you’re doing.\n",

There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
