Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

Before that, he sold his AI startup untapt (because why not?).\\n\\nFun fact: his Udemy courses on Large Language Models have gone viral-ish with 400,000 students across 190 countries. So, yes, Ed knows his stuff — and he accidentally became a teacher.\\n\\n### What’s Cooking?\\n- **AI Curriculum:** Ed’s prized collection of AI courses (for those who want to join the fan club).\\n- **Connect Four & Outsmart:** Cool projects where LLMs brawl with diplomacy and sneaky tactics. AI throwing shade at each other? Sign us up.\\n- **Snazzy Blog Posts & Updates:** Highlights include AI voice agents, live AI events, and tips on course ordering. The future's bright and scripted.\\n\\n### Newsflash:\\nEd occasionally drops emails with actual value (shocker), and has fresh posts ranging from January 2026 (because we’re living in the future here) focusing on AI builders, live events, and engineering AI into production without exploding.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBasically, this site is your backstage pass to Ed’s AI obsessions, tutorials, and nerdy projects — plus a dash of “please subscribe or I’ll keep bugging you” charm.\""
