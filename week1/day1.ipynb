Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

       "\"# Edward Donner's Digital Lair\\n\\nSo, Edward (Ed) is your friendly neighborhood code tinkerer and LLM wrangler who also moonlights as a DJ—albeit one who’s “badly out of practice” (because who hasn’t been there, Ed?). He’s co-founder and CTO of Nebula.io, where AI isn’t just buzzwords but apparently helps recruiters play matchmaker with talent using some fancy patented matchmaking wizardry.\\n\\nHis site offers a little “battle arena” called *Outsmart,* where large language models duke it out in a game of diplomacy and deviousness. Because nothing says fun like AI drama.\\n\\nNewsflash: Ed’s been busy dropping AI knowledge bombs all over 2025 with topics like *Gen AI on AWS,* AI executive briefings, and courses designed to turn you into an agentic AI overlord—er, engineer.\\n\\nWant to reach Ed? He’s just an email away, probably coding or secretly DJing in the background.\""
