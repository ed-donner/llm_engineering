Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "**Position Overview:**\n",
      "White to move, and we see an endgame with rooks off the board except for White's active rook on c6 and Black's rook on b8. Material is roughly balanced, but White seems to have more spatial control on the queenside with those advanced pawns and a more active rook.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Positional Assessment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **White's Assets:**\n",
      "  - The rook on c6 is excellently placed, controlling the 6th rank and putting pressure on Black's queenside pawns.\n",
      "  - The pawn structure shows cheeky, advanced pawns on b5 and a4, claiming space. The b5-pawn restricts Black's a5-pawn, and b6, c7 squares can be targets.\n",
      "  - White's king on g4 is quite active in the kingside area; it supports potential king-side pawn expansion if needed.\n",
      "  - Pawns on e5 and g2 support central and kingside control.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Black's Assets:**\n",
      "  - The rook on b8 is defending down the b-file but somewhat passive.\n",
      "  - The pawn on b6 and e6 have potential to advance but are currently constrained.\n",
      "  - The Black king on e7 sits centrally but is somewhat tied to defense duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Tactical/Strategical Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- White's rook on c6 is perfectly placed to attack Black's weaknesses, especially the backward b6 pawn.\n",
      "- Black's a5-pawn is under pressure from White's b5 pawn and the rook on c6.\n",
      "- White could consider moves like Rc7+ followed by pushing the b-pawn further, or bringing the king closer to the center.\n",
      "- Black's rook has limited scope; it might consider doubling ranks if possible, but the b-file is mostly White-controlled now.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Candidate moves for White:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Rc7+ to check the Black king, forcing it to a less comfortable square, potentially e8 or d8.\n",
      "- After Rc7+, White could push the b-pawn to b6, hammering Black's queenside structure.\n",
      "- Alternatively, White could improve king position with Kf4 to centralize and prepare for endgame pawn advances.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "White stands better here due to superior rook activity and the advanced pawn structure on the queenside. The rook on c6 dominates the b-file and supports pawn pushes that will create weaknesses in Black's position. Black must find counterplay or risk being gradually squeezed.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Magnus Carlsen’s style: “In these positions, keep the pressure on. The rook on c6 is your main tool — use it aggressively to pry open the queenside and create passed pawns. Black has no easy counterplay, so patient, precise play advancing your pawns and coordinating your king should yield a winning position.”\n"
