Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

In reality, effective salary discussions begin long before numbers are exchanged. They are shaped by preparation, context, and how clearly you communicate your value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first mistake many candidates make is treating compensation as a single number. Employers do not. Internally, compensation decisions balance role scope, market data, team equity, budget cycles, and perceived risk. Understanding this helps job seekers approach the conversation with realism instead of emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market awareness is foundational. This means knowing not only general salary ranges, but also how your experience level, location, industry, and role focus affect compensation. Titles alone are misleading. Two people with the same title can be paid very differently based on impact, complexity, and accountability. Strong candidates ground their expectations in evidence, not assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing also matters. Salary conversations are most effective once alignment is established. When an employer sees clear fit and reduced risk, flexibility increases. This is why early interviews should focus on demonstrating relevance, problem solving, and results rather than leading with compensation demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence in negotiation does not come from aggressiveness. It comes from clarity. Be prepared to explain how your skills, experience, and outcomes support your range. Ask thoughtful questions about growth, performance expectations, and total compensation. These signals show maturity and partnership.\n",
