Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell.

    "A final thought. While I've designed these notebooks to be educational, I've also tried to make them enjoyable. We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me."

    "- Do a Kernel >> Restart kernel, and execute the cells in this Jupyter lab starting at the top\n",
    "4. As a fallback, replace the line `openai = OpenAI()` with `openai = OpenAI(api_key=\"your-key-here\")` - while it's not recommended to hard code tokens in Jupyter lab, because then you can't share your lab with others, it's a workaround for now\n",
