    "Upgrade the day 1 project to summarize a webpage to use an Open Source model running locally via Ollama rather than OpenAI\n",

    "You'll be able to use this technique for all subsequent projects if you'd prefer not to use paid APIs.\n",

    "1. No API charges - open-source\n",
    "2. Data doesn't leave your box\n",

    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. Significantly less power than Frontier Model\n",
