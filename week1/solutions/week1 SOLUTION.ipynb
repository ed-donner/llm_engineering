       "**Code Breakdown**\n",
       "\n",
       "The given code is a Python expression that uses a combination of features such as list comprehension, dictionary access, and `yield from`. Let's break it down:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's what each part does:\n",
       "\n",
       "- `{...}`: This is a dictionary literal. The values are extracted using the `.get()` method.\n",
       "\n",
       "- `(book.get(\"author\"))`: For each `book` in the list, this extracts the value associated with the key `\"author\"` from that book (if it exists).\n",
       "\n",
       "- `[... for book in books if ...]`: This is a list comprehension, where:\n",
       "\n",
       "  - `for book in books`: Iterates over each `book` in the `books` list.\n",
       "\n",
       "  - `if book.get(\"author\")`: Only includes the iteration of `book` in the resulting list if the value associated with `\"author\"` for that book exists. This is because `yield from` requires its argument to be an iterable.\n",
       "\n",
       "- `yield from ...`: Once we have the list comprehension, it becomes the iterable itself. The `yield from` statement allows us to create a generator that \"forwards\" control to the next iterable (in this case, the dictionary extracted by the list comprehension).\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it Works**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a step-by-step example:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Assume `books` is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with an `\"author\"` key.\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 1\", \"author\": \"John Doe\"},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 2\", \"author\": None},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 3\", \"author\": \"Jane Smith\"}\n",
       "]\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The code starts by iterating over each book in `books`.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. For each book, it checks if the `\"author\"` key exists and is not `None`. If so, it includes that author's name in a new dictionary.\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "{ \n",
       "    \"John Doe\": None,\n",
       "    None: None,  # This won't be included because it's None\n",
       "    \"Jane Smith\": None\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Once we have the list of authors (if any exist), we then yield from that list using `yield from`.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The resulting generator will produce each author's name on demand, rather than having to load all the book data at once.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example Use Case**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an example use case for this code:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def get_authors(books):\n",
       "    return (\n",
       "        yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
