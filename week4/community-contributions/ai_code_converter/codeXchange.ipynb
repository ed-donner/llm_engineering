    "\n",
    "**codeXchange AI** is a web-based tool that simplifies converting code between different programming languages. It uses advanced open-source language models and cutting-edge AI to quickly and accurately translate your code. Supporting conversion across 17 programming languages, this tool is perfect whether you’re learning a new language or optimizing multi-language projects. With its user-friendly interface, you can even have your code documented automatically by simply ticking the documentation option—this adds appropriate docstrings following the native documentation style of the target language. Developed as part of the [LLM Engineering course](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/learn/lecture/46867711#content) by Ed. Donner.\n",
