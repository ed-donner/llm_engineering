**Task Overview:**  
Thoroughly analyze the entire codebase and gain a deep understanding of the application flow diagram and the interaction sequence between all components.  

**Objective:**  
Develop a comprehensive understanding of how different modules interact, their dependencies, and how data flows across the system. This foundational knowledge will be essential for implementing future updates accurately and efficiently without breaking the existing codebase.

**Important Note:**  
⚠️ **No code should be written or modified at this stage.** The primary focus is on understanding the architecture, relationships, and dependencies to ensure a seamless update process in subsequent phases.
