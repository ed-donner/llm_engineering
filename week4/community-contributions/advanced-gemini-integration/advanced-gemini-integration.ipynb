    "This notebook uses the **top 3 frontier models for code generation** as of July 2025, instead of the two models suggested in the original course (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The selection is based on research conducted using GPT o3 Pro with the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Do research and find the 5 top code generation Frontier Models as of July 2025 - rank in descending order\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top 5 Code Generation Frontier Models (July 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Model & Provider | Representative 2025 Results* | Reasons for Placement |\n",
    "|------|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| 1 | **Claude Opus 4** – Anthropic (May 2025) | SWE‑Bench Verified 72.5% (no tool‑tricks) | Highest real‑repository pass‑rate; sustained multi‑hour \"extended thinking\" agent runs; strong enterprise adoption. |\n",
    "| 2 | **Gemini 2.5 Pro** – Google DeepMind (Mar 2025) | SWE‑Bench Verified 63.8% with custom agent | Second‑best on agentic coding; 1M token context and fastest multimodal reasoning aid large codebases. |\n",
    "| 3 | **GPT‑4.1** – OpenAI (Apr 2025) | SWE‑Bench Verified 54.6% with plain scaffolding | Major jump over GPT‑4o; competitive latency/cost; still leading ecosystem integrations (Copilot, ChatGPT Code‑Interpreter). |\n",
    "| 4 | DeepSeek V3‑0324 – DeepSeek AI (Dec 2024 open‑weight) | Human‑Eval 96.9% (EG‑CFG variant) | Highest function‑level correctness among open models; MoE design keeps inference cheap; 128K context, permissive licence. |\n",
    "| 5 | Codestral 25.01 – Mistral AI (Jan 2025 open‑weight) | Human‑Eval 86.6%, MBPP 80.2%, RepoBench 38.0% | Fastest open model in its size class, 256K context, excellent fill‑in‑the‑middle and multi‑language support. |\n",

    "## Major Enhancements in This Version\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been significantly enhanced with advanced Gemini 2.5 Pro integration and sophisticated performance tracking capabilities. Here's what's new:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ Gemini Safety Filter Solution\n",
    "**Problem Solved**: Gemini 2.5 Pro's safety filters were blocking complex code conversion requests, especially for algorithms involving random number generation, mathematical computations, and array processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Implemented a robust **13-approach fallback system** in the `optimize_gemini()` function that:\n",
    "- Tries different system instruction styles (academic, tutorial, algorithm-focused, etc.)\n",
    "- Uses varied prompt approaches (gentle, direct, minimal, mathematical, etc.)\n",
    "- Systematically attempts each approach until one succeeds\n",
    "- Handles safety filter responses gracefully with detailed error reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Intelligent Fallback System\n",
    "- **Smart Recovery**: When a model fails (especially Gemini safety filters), automatically uses the last successful C++ conversion from any model\n",
    "- **Transparent Operation**: Clear visual indicators show when fallback is active and which model's code is being used\n",
    "- **Performance Preservation**: Maintains performance tracking even when using fallback code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Advanced Performance Analytics\n",
    "Built a comprehensive **Gradio web interface** featuring:\n",
    "- **Real-time Performance Comparison Table**: Shows Python vs C++ execution times for each model\n",
    "- **Model-Specific Tracking**: Each model (GPT, Claude, Gemini) gets separate timing when selected\n",
    "- **Intelligent Performance Messages**: Detailed comparisons like \"Gemini used GPT's code. C++ execution time was 0.536421s which was faster by 0.003215s compared to GPT's original time\"\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and status indicators for failed conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Technical Improvements\n",
    "- **Enhanced State Management**: Multiple `gr.State` objects track successful code, models, and fallback status\n",
    "- **Sophisticated Event Chaining**: Complex Gradio workflows with `.then()` operations for seamless user experience\n",
    "- **CSS Styling**: Professional visual feedback with status messages and color-coded outputs\n",
    "- **Robust Error Detection**: Comprehensive error classification and user-friendly messaging\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 User Experience Enhancements\n",
    "- **Clean Initial State**: Empty table values instead of \"N/A\" placeholders\n",
    "- **Status Messages**: Red-bordered warning messages for conversion failures\n",
    "- **Performance Insights**: Real-time execution time extraction and comparison\n",
    "- **Professional Interface**: Modern, responsive design with clear visual hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Testing Results\n",
    "The enhanced system successfully handles:\n",
    "- ✅ Simple algorithms (like pi calculation) - all models work\n",
    "- ✅ Complex algorithms with safety filter challenges - fallback system activates\n",
    "- ✅ Performance tracking across all scenarios\n",
    "- ✅ Graceful error handling and user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhancement transforms a basic code conversion tool into a **sophisticated performance analysis platform** with enterprise-grade reliability and user experience.\n"
