# or are they really?
See the CPP code - GPT took it and produced some "magic" math operations
out of the blue to arrive with the correct result for PI.
But it's not parameterizable like other implementations, not to mention
the original Python code. 4 and 1 are treated like constants in the produced code...

Submitting for fun...
