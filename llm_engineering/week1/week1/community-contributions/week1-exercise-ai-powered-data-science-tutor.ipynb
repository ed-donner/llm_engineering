       "2. **Question Formatting**: Ensure to pass the `question` into the `messages` parameter as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the 'role' of the speaker (like 'user' or 'assistant') and the message content.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Updating Display**: Using `IPython.display` allows real-time updates of the Markdown output in environments like Jupyter notebooks.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for HTTP errors or issues with the streaming process. This ensures that your function can gracefully handle problems.\n",

       "5. **Environment Compatibility**: This code works seamlessly in an interactive environment that supports IPython, such as Jupyter notebooks.\n",

       "Hello there! It seems like you're working with the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate human-like responses. The code snippet you provided is quite interesting, and I'll do my best to break it down for you.\n",
       "\n",
       "**What this code does**\n",
       "\n",
       "This `stream_gpt` function appears to be a wrapper around the OpenAI API, which generates text completions based on user input (you). Here's what the function does in detail:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Create GPT-4 model instance**: It creates an instance of the GPT-4 model using the `MODEL_GPT` variable, which suggests that this is a predefined model configuration.\n",
       "2. **Open API stream**: It opens a connection to the OpenAI API's completions endpoint using the `openai.chat.completions.create` method, passing in the `model` parameter (the GPT-4 instance) and the `messages` parameter (your question).\n",
       "\n",
       "   python\n",
       "stream = openai.chat.completions.create(\n",
       "    model=MODEL_GPT,\n",
       "    messages=question,\n",
       "    stream=True\n",
       ")\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "   The `stream=True` parameter is necessary because we want to read responses from the API in real-time without having to wait for the entire response to be received.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Process responses**: Inside an infinite loop (`forchunk in stream:`), it reads and processes each chunk of response from the API:\n",
       "\n",
       "    python\n",
       "for chunk in stream:\n",
       "response += chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ''\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "   - `chunk` is a dictionary-like object containing information about the API's response.\n",
       "   - `choices` is an array of possible completions, with only one choice shown (`[0]`) by default. We're assuming this is the primary completion we want to display.\n",
       "   - `.delta.content` gives us the actual text response from the API. This could be a full paragraph, sentence, or even just a word.\n",
       "   - `response += chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ''`: We simply append any remaining text from previous chunks if there was one.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Format and display**: It reformats the response to remove Markdown formatting (``)) and then uses a `display` function to show an updated version of the original question:\n",
       "\n",
       "    python\n",
       "response = response.replace(\"\", \"\").replace(\"\", \"\")\n",
       "update_display(Markdown(response), display_id=display_handle.display_id)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Update display**: After formatting, it updates the display with the latest response.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Issue concerns**\n",
       "\n",
       "One potential issue here: `while True` or a similar loop structure should be used instead of an `Infinite` loop for this streamer's functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, error handling would be necessary if we wanted more control over any possible errors while streaming results from API requests."
