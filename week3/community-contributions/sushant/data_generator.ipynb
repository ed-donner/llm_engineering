    "- The Business Logic & Correlations: (This is critical for realism. e.g., \"If Status is 'Shipped', then Delivery_Date must be populated,\" or \"High Salary correlates with Senior job titles.\")\n",

    "- Edge Cases & Noise: (Do you want perfect data, or should I introduce realistic errors like NULL values, typos, or outliers?)\n",

       "   - Which specific revenue‑related variables do you need (e.g., MRR, ARR, churn, expansion, new‑customer acquisition)?\n",

       "2. **Schema – Required Columns & Data Types**  \n",
       "   - List the columns you *must* have in the output (e.g., `customer_id`, `plan_type`, `month`, `revenue`, `status`).  \n",
       "   - For each column, specify the desired data type (e.g., integer, string, date, float).  \n",

       "     - If `status = \"Churned\"` then `revenue` for that month must be 0.  \n",
       "     - `expansion_amount` should only be > 0 when `status = \"Active\"` and `plan_type` is “Premium”.  \n",
       "     - `new_customer_acquisition` should be 0 for months prior to a customer’s first `signup_date`.  \n",
       "   - Are there any hierarchical or sequential constraints (e.g., a customer’s `plan_type` can only upgrade, not downgrade, within a given time window)?\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Edge Cases & Noise**  \n",
       "   - Do you want the data to be perfectly clean, or should it contain realistic imperfections?  \n",
       "     - NULL / missing values?  \n",
       "     - Typos or out‑of‑range values?  \n",
       "     - occasional impossible dates or negative numbers?  \n",
       "   - If you need noise, specify the type and magnitude (e.g., “add ±5 % random noise to revenue”, “10 % of rows should have a typo in `plan_type`”).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Volume & Format**  \n",
       "   - Approximate number of rows you need (e.g., 10 k, 100 k, 1 M).  \n",
       "   - Desired output format: CSV, JSON Lines, SQL INSERT statements, Parquet, etc.  \n",
       "   - Any specific column ordering or header naming conventions?\n",
