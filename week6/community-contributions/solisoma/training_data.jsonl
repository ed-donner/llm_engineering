The vent ring is made from a hard PPSU plastic that is co-molded with a soft silicone vent sleeve to create a one-piece, easy to clean advanced vent. Air flows into the bottle through four evenly spaced openings ensuring proper venting regardless of how the bottle is held. Proper venting reduces air intake by your baby and prevents vacuum effects. All of this helps reduce colic. The CleanFlow vent ring has four lock notches that fit perfectly into the bottle's neck, eliminating over and under tightening that can cause leaks and/or result in inconsistent liquid flows. Parents go to great lengths sterilizing bottle components only to handle parts with unsterilized hands. The vent's unique design allows assembly while touching only the hard cent ring - but not the silicone vent sleeve that comes in contact with the feeding liquids. The Joovy Boob Baby Bottle's CleanFlow Vent assures cleaning, assembly and feeding are easy - and consistent.\n    Features: Proper venting is critical in preventing vacuum effects and reduces air intake by your baby The unique design has 4 lock notches that fit perfectly into the bottle's neck, eliminating over and under tightening which can cause leaks and/or inconsistent liquid flow The vent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.99"}]}
