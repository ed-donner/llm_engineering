Subject: Week 6 Day 5 - Fix OpenAI Fine-Tuning Moderation Failures

Hi there,

I'm submitting a fix for Week 6 Day 5 where fine-tuning jobs fail after training completes.

ROOT CAUSE:
OpenAI error: "Unfortunately, your fine-tuning job ftjob-pJwYT39SqD8inEtpIVrGWTw6 has failed."

The issue: Training completes successfully (200/200 steps), but OpenAI's post-training safety evaluation (refusals_v3) rejects models trained on data containing weapon/tactical keywords (knife, blade, combat, tactical). These trigger the "hate/threatening" category.

SOLUTION:
- Added content moderation filtering (keyword + OpenAI API)
- Filters 12 problematic items (200→190 train, 50→48 validation)
- Includes pre-cleaned JSONL files ready to use
- Maintains quality (190 exceeds OpenAI's 50-100 recommendation)

RESULT:
✅ Successfully deployed: ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal:pricer:CQUN1Nk6

FILES (9 files, ~392 KB):
- Modified day5.ipynb with check_moderation() function
- fix_moderation.py & test_moderation.py scripts
- Pre-cleaned training/validation data
- Comprehensive documentation

This saves users 30-60 min troubleshooting and $5-10 in wasted API costs.

Best regards,
Bilal-jamal
