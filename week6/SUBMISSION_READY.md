git commit -m "feat(week6): Add OpenAI fine-tuning moderation fix for day5

Prevents fine-tuning job failures during post-training safety evaluations.

**Problem:**
- Training jobs fail with 'refusals_v3' moderation error
- Error category: hate/threatening  
- Caused by weapon/tactical keywords in product descriptions

**Solution:**
- Added check_moderation() function to filter sensitive content
- Two-stage filtering: keyword pre-filter + OpenAI Moderation API
- Reduces training set from 200 to 190 examples (maintains quality)
- Includes standalone scripts and pre-cleaned JSONL files

**Testing:**
- Successfully completed fine-tuning job
- Model deployed: ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal:pricer:CQUN1Nk6
- Tested on macOS with Python 3.11, OpenAI SDK 1.58.1

**Files Included:**
- Modified day5.ipynb notebook
- fix_moderation.py (filtering script)  
- test_moderation.py (testing utility)
- Pre-cleaned training/validation JSONL files (190 + 48 examples)
- Comprehensive documentation

## üéØ What to Include in PR Description

```markdown
## Summary
Fixes critical issue where OpenAI fine-tuning jobs fail during post-training 
moderation checks (refusals_v3 evaluation) in Week 6 Day 5 notebook.

## Problem
Training data contained product descriptions with weapon/tactical keywords 
(knife, blade, combat, tactical) that triggered OpenAI's hate/threatening 
safety category, causing job failures after successful training completion.

## Solution
1. Added `check_moderation()` function to notebook
2. Created standalone filtering scripts with two-stage filtering:
   - Keyword pre-filter (25+ sensitive terms)
   - OpenAI Moderation API verification
3. Included pre-cleaned JSONL files ready to use
4. Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Results
- **Before:** 200 examples ‚Üí ‚ùå Failed moderation
- **After:** 190 examples ‚Üí ‚úÖ Passed successfully
- **Filtered:** 10 training items, 2 validation items

## Testing
‚úÖ Successfully completed fine-tuning job: `ftjob-moQGns3ajsS5UWIZuId0u5hL`  
‚úÖ Model deployed: `ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal:pricer:CQUN1Nk6`  
‚úÖ Tested on macOS, Python 3.11, OpenAI SDK 1.58.1

## Benefits to Community
- Prevents wasted time and API costs from failed jobs
- Educational: demonstrates OpenAI safety evaluation best practices
- Reusable: scripts work for other fine-tuning projects
- Production-ready: efficient two-stage filtering
- No breaking changes to original code

## Files Included
- `day5.ipynb` - Modified notebook with moderation fix
- `fix_moderation.py` - Standalone filtering script (6 KB)
- `test_moderation.py` - Testing utility (3 KB)
- `items.py` - Required dependency (3 KB)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `data/fine_tune_train.jsonl` - 190 pre-cleaned examples (183 KB)
- `data/fine_tune_validation.jsonl` - 48 pre-cleaned examples (46 KB)
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation (12 KB)
- `MODERATION_FIX_README.md` - Technical deep dive (7 KB)

**Total package size:** ~392 KB

## Usage
Users have 3 options:
1. **Fastest:** Use pre-cleaned JSONL files (skip filtering)
2. **Customizable:** Run `fix_moderation.py` on their data
3. **Educational:** Use modified notebook cells
