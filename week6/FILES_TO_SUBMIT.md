## 📧 PR Description Template

```markdown
## Description
Fixes critical issue in Week 6 Day 5 where OpenAI fine-tuning jobs fail during
post-training moderation checks (refusals_v3 evaluation).

## Problem
Training data contained product descriptions with weapon/tactical keywords that
triggered OpenAI's hate/threatening safety category, causing job failures after
successful training completion.

## Solution
- Added `check_moderation()` function to notebook
- Created standalone filtering scripts with keyword + API two-stage filtering
- Included pre-cleaned JSONL files (190 train, 48 validation examples)
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Testing
✅ Successfully completed fine-tuning job: ftjob-moQGns3ajsS5UWIZuId0u5hL
✅ Model deployed: ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal:pricer:CQUN1Nk6
✅ Tested on macOS with Python 3.11, OpenAI SDK 1.58.1

## Files Included
- Modified day5.ipynb notebook
- fix_moderation.py (filtering script)
- test_moderation.py (testing utility)
- Pre-cleaned training/validation JSONL files
- Comprehensive documentation

## Benefits
- Prevents wasted time and API costs from failed jobs
- Educational value for understanding OpenAI safety evaluations
- Reusable scripts for other fine-tuning projects
- No breaking changes to original code structure
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **File Naming**: Use descriptive folder names like `bilal-jamal-day5-moderation-fix` not just `day5-fix`

2. **Documentation**: The README.md should be comprehensive - it's the first thing users see

3. **Data Files**: Include pre-cleaned JSONLs! They're small and save users money

4. **Testing**: Mention your successful job ID in documentation for credibility

5. **Requirements**: Pin minimum versions but allow upgrades (`>=` not `==`)
