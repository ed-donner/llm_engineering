    "<br>\n",
    "<br>A ideia central:\n",
    "\n",
    "Em vez de depender apenas da memória do modelo, você o alimenta com o conhecimento certo, na hora certa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## O que vimos até então, técnicas simples para melhorar prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Multi-shot prompting\n",
    "<br>Você dá vários exemplos no prompt para ensinar o modelo como quer que ele responda.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Uso de ferramentas\n",
    "<br>O modelo chama APIs, bancos de dados, funções — ampliando suas capacidades.\n",

    "• Contexto adicional\n",
    "<br>Você fornece textos, regras ou dados relevantes diretamente dentro do prompt.\n",

    "<br>• Orquestrar prompts e pipelines complexos.\n",
    "<br>• Conectar LLMs a bases de dados usando RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).\n",

    "Here are 10 practical chunking techniques 👇\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Fixed Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Split text into equal-sized segments\n",
    "<br>→ Simple and fast, best for structured or uniform content\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Overlapping Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Include a few sentences from the previous chunk\n",
    "<br>→ Preserves context and improves continuity across sections\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Semantic Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Use embeddings to split text by meaning instead of length\n",
    "<br>→ Ideal for unstructured data like blogs, articles, or transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ Advanced Semantic Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Add clustering or transformer-based segmentation for smarter splits\n",
    "<br>→ Great for long, domain-heavy or multi-topic documents\n",
    "\n",
    "5️⃣ Recursive Character Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Break text recursively until each chunk fits the model’s token limit\n",
    "<br>→ Adapts dynamically to different model sizes and limits\n",
    "\n",
    "6️⃣ Sentence-Based Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Split at sentence boundaries to preserve linguistic integrity\n",
    "<br>→ Best for summarization and factual QA systems\n",
    "\n",
    "7️⃣ Context-Enriched Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Add neighboring text (before and after) to enrich each chunk\n",
    "<br>→ Improves recall and multi-step reasoning accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "8️⃣ Paragraph Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Use natural paragraph structure to form coherent retrieval units\n",
    "<br>→ Works best for PDFs, reports, and research papers\n",
    "\n",
    "9️⃣ Agentic Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Let an LLM agent decide chunk boundaries dynamically\n",
    "<br>→ Perfect for topic-aware or intent-driven retrieval systems\n",
    "\n",
    "🔟 Token-Based Chunking\n",
    "<br>→ Split text precisely by token count for model alignment\n",
    "<br>→ Maximizes context usage without exceeding token limits\n",
