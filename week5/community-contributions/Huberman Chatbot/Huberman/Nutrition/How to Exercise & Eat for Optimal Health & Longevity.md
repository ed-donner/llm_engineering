# **How to Exercise & Eat for Optimal Health & Longevity**

Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, an expert in geriatrics, nutrition, health, and longevity, underscores a groundbreaking perspective on the human body: **muscle is the organ of longevity**. While traditionally associated with exercise performance, mobility, and strength, Dr. Lyon explains that muscle is a unique and critical organ system vital for immediate and long-term health, affecting every other organ system in the body.

### **Understanding Muscle: More Than Just Movement**

Muscle is identified as an **organ system, an endocrine organ**, and is primarily responsible for approximately **80% of glucose disposal**. Dr. Lyon highlights that many metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, often originate in skeletal muscle decades before symptoms become apparent. Muscle also serves as an **amino acid reservoir**, a crucial aspect given that protein turnover changes with age.

A significant insight came from Dr. Lyon's fellowship in geriatrics and nutrition sciences, where she observed a patient whose brain imaging suggested early Alzheimer's disease despite following conventional health advice like a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet and exercising. Dr. Lyon realised the issue wasn't that the patient was "overfat" but rather **"under-muscled"**. This led her to conclude that the focus of health should shift from treating obesity to prioritising skeletal muscle health.

Contrary to popular belief, skeletal muscle is not highly metabolically active at rest, burning only about **10 calories per pound and primarily using fatty acids**. However, its role in **glucose disposal** is paramount; it stores glucose as glycogen, protecting the body from the toxic effects of high blood glucose. When an individual is inactive, muscle becomes "overpacked" with glycogen, leading to substrates remaining in the bloodstream, which is a sign of unhealthy skeletal muscle indicated by elevated insulin, blood glucose, free fatty acids, and branch-chain amino acids.

While it's challenging to precisely quantify the optimal amount of skeletal muscle for health, Dr. Lyon explains that blood markers like elevated triglycerides, insulin, or glucose can indicate poor muscle health. The concept of **sarcopenia** – a decrease in muscle mass and function – was only classified as a disease in 2016, highlighting the infancy of our understanding of optimal muscle health.

### **Nutritional Pillars for Muscle Health**

Skeletal muscle is a **nutrient-sensing organ**, uniquely sensitive to the quality of our diet, particularly the **amino acids** (dietary protein). **Leucine**, one of the branch-chain amino acids, is specifically noted for its unique ability to stimulate skeletal muscle, triggering **muscle protein synthesis** (a marker for overall muscle health).

To cultivate healthy muscle, a strategic approach to nutrition is essential:

* **Prioritise Dietary Protein:** The most crucial element. The general recommendation is **1 gram of high-quality protein per pound of ideal body weight** per day. For example, a person aiming for 150 lbs should target 150 grams of protein daily.

  * **Meal Thresholds:** Each meal, especially the **first and last**, should contain **30 to 50 grams of high-quality protein** to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Below this threshold, muscle health is not adequately stimulated.  
  * **Protein Quality:** Animal-based proteins (eggs, whey protein, beef, poultry, venison) are considered "higher quality" due to their amino acid composition being similar to human body composition, containing essential amino acids in appropriate ratios. While plant-based proteins can suffice, they typically require a higher total protein load to achieve the necessary amino acid profile, as they may come with more carbohydrates and have different absorption rates due to fibre content. For instance, six cups of quinoa equate to one small chicken breast in amino acid profile.  
  * **Protein Assimilation:** The body can assimilate all ingested protein, even 100 grams, but muscle protein synthesis will likely max out around **55 grams per meal**. The remainder is oxidised and used as fuel.  
  * **Protein Hierarchy:** The total protein intake over 24 hours matters most, followed by quality and then distribution. The current RDA of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (approx. 37g per pound) is considered a **minimum to prevent deficiency**, not to support optimal muscle health, especially as one ages.  
  * **Aging and Protein Needs:** As individuals age, the efficiency of muscle protein synthesis decreases, requiring **more protein** to stimulate muscle (e.g., 40-50 grams per meal for those over 50-60). This helps older individuals respond to protein like younger ones.  
* **Carbohydrate Intake:** Dr. Lyon suggests that carbohydrates shouldn't be the primary focus. For sedentary individuals, a recommendation of **130 grams of carbohydrates per day** is provided. Most Americans consume over double this amount.

  * Outside of exercise, meals should contain **40 to 50 grams of carbohydrates** to mitigate significant insulin response. Higher amounts of carbohydrates can be "earned" through exercise (40-70 grams per hour depending on intensity).  
  * The brain is metabolically active and uses a lot of carbohydrates, influencing the 130-gram recommendation.  
  * **Glucose Dominance:** When a mixed meal is consumed, the body prioritises glucose disposal because high glucose levels can be toxic.  
  * **Protein's Role in Glucose Generation:** A higher protein diet can lead to the body generating its own glucose (e.g., 60 grams of glucose from 100 grams of protein through gluconeogenesis), which is a slower process than consuming carbohydrates directly.  
  * **Essential Carbohydrates:** There are no essential carbohydrates.  
* **Fat Intake:** After prioritising protein and considering carbohydrates, fats make up the remainder of caloric needs. It's easy to obtain essential fatty acids without a very high-fat diet.

* **Meal Timing and Fasting:** While the timing of the first meal may not matter for young, healthy individuals, it becomes more important with age. For older individuals or those struggling to build muscle, extended fasting is not necessarily recommended due to the need to balance muscle protein synthesis and catabolism. The muscle protein synthetic response from a meal lasts about 2 hours, but other factors like eIF4 maintain themselves for 4-5 hours, meaning subsequent meals primarily contribute to overall protein intake rather than immediate muscle protein synthesis.

### **Strategic Exercise for Muscle Preservation and Growth**

**Resistance training is non-negotiable** for muscle health. It is one of the two primary ways to stimulate skeletal muscle, alongside dietary protein.

* **Frequency and Intensity:** Dr. Lyon trains three days a week with a full-body workout, focusing on compound movements like push, pull, hinge, and squat exercises. She emphasizes that the final repetitions should be challenging with sufficient load to stimulate **hypertrophy (muscle growth)**.  
* **"High Ground" Movements:** For those new or unskilled in lifting, **machine-based exercises** ("High Ground movements") are recommended because they offer support, reduce injury risk, and allow for focused muscle contraction. Examples include hack squats, leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, lat pull-downs, and supported rows. Avoiding injury is paramount for lifelong fitness.  
* **Benefits of Resistance Training:**  
  * **Glucose Utilisation:** Exercise increases the density of **GLUT4 receptors** on the muscle surface, allowing glucose to move from the bloodstream into cells without requiring insulin. This directly combats insulin resistance.  
  * **Myokines:** Muscle contraction releases **myokines** (peptide hormones) like Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-15, which are endocrine functions of muscle. These myokines affect lipolysis and glucose utilisation, can dampen inflammation, and stimulate **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)** release in the brain. BDNF is crucial for consolidating existing synaptic connections, thereby maintaining and improving brain function, which typically declines with age.  
  * **Bone Health:** Muscle pulls on bone, creating the necessary load and stimulation for bone building, helping to prevent osteoporosis.  
  * **Overall Survivability:** Higher amounts of healthy skeletal muscle correlate with greater survivability against nearly any disease, including cancer cachexia (wasting).  
* **Cardiovascular Training:** While cardiovascular activity and VO2 max are important, Dr. Lyon suggests that **high-intensity interval training (HIIT)** can increase VO2 max in significantly less time and potentially be safer for individuals than prolonged slow-steady state cardio, especially as joints age. Improving strength and hypertrophy also contributes to improved VO2 max and other clinical outcomes like blood pressure and triglyceride levels.

### **Supporting Muscle Health with Key Supplements**

Alongside diet and exercise, certain supplements can play a beneficial role.

* **Creatine Monohydrate:** Highly recommended, with benefits for muscle strength and emerging research for brain health, particularly in women and older populations. The amount of creatine in food like steak is relatively low (approx. 2 grams per pound).  
* **Urolithin A:** A postbiotic produced by the gut microbiome (though most individuals cannot produce it naturally). It improves mitophagy (mitochondrial health and turnover) and has been shown in human trials to increase strength and endurance. Recommended doses are typically between 500-1000 mg.  
* **Whey Protein:** A processed food, but a "great way to get essential amino acids" with little downside and easy tolerability, especially for travel. Whey protein isolate is suitable for those with lactose challenges.  
* **Fish Oil/Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Beneficial for brain function and appears to have an anabolic effect on muscle. General recommendations are around 4-10 grams per day, though individual needs vary.  
* **Collagen:** While not a complete protein for muscle building (protein score of zero, low in essential amino acids like tryptophan and branch-chain amino acids), it is rich in glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. It can be beneficial for skin, hair, and nails. Higher doses (above 15g, possibly closer to 25g) might be beneficial, but more research is needed.  
* **Magnesium:** Supplementation is often beneficial as dietary magnesium can be lower due to soil depletion.  
* **Zinc:** If eating a whole-foods diet, zinc deficiency is unlikely. If supplementing, it should be balanced with copper to maintain the body's zinc-copper ratio.

### **Navigating Challenges to Muscle Health**

Certain factors or medications can inadvertently disrupt muscle health:

* **Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen:** Higher doses may negatively impact muscle health (hypertrophy and strength) and are not good for gastric lining, which affects nutrient absorption. Occasional use is generally acceptable.  
* **Statins:** While necessary for some, they can cause side effects like muscle pain (myalgia) and deplete CoQ10.  
* **Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics (e.g., Cipro):** Can affect collagen and tendon turnover, increasing the risk of Achilles tendon injuries.  
* **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):** Used for stomach acid/reflux, they can affect the absorption of vitamins and minerals crucial for health.  
* **GLP-1 Analogues (e.g., Ozempic, Mounjaro):** These medications are highly effective for weight loss (13% for GLP-1 agonists, 22% for dual agonists like Mounjaro), transforming lives, particularly for individuals struggling with obesity or food addiction.  
  * **Muscle Loss:** While there can be some muscle loss, Dr. Lyon states that **with a proper nutrition plan (high protein) and resistance training, significant loss of skeletal muscle mass is not observed in her practice**.  
  * **Benefits and Risks:** These drugs can suppress appetite and cravings. While there are discussions about side effects like slowed gastric emptying (an intended mechanism), pancreatitis, or thyroid cancer (often based on rodent models with different thyroid physiology), Dr. Lyon notes they have been used for over a decade. They can also positively influence alcohol consumption and other addictions.

### **The Crucial Role of Mindset**

Dr. Lyon stresses that even the most perfect health plan is ineffective without the right mindset and willingness to execute.

* **Set Standards, Not Goals:** People often set weight loss or muscle hypertrophy goals, but **standards remain and provide a framework for consistent execution**, regardless of how one feels. Goals can come and go, but standards persist.  
* **Know Your Points of Vulnerability:** Successful individuals understand where they fail and their weaknesses. Vulnerability often occurs at moments of peak success or immediately after a significant achievement, where dopamine highs or subsequent lows can lead to falling off track. Recognizing these predictable human behaviours is key to maintaining long-term health.  
* **Embrace Neutrality:** Managing and mitigating emotional highs and lows helps maintain consistency. This "level of neutrality" allows individuals to be steady and less prone to falling off track during life's big moments. It's a trainable skill that conserves mental energy.  
* **Feel Worthy of Health:** Dr. Lyon believes that individuals will only be as healthy as they feel worthy of. If a person doesn't feel worthy of health, they may sabotage themselves, focusing on feeling unwell as a distraction. Overcoming this internal narrative is essential for achieving and maintaining well-being.

### **Holistic Benefits of Healthy Muscle**

In summary, the benefits of healthy muscle are pervasive. Muscle is inextricably linked to **better metabolic health, better blood pressure, increased survivability against illness or injury, improved strength and mobility, and acts as "body armour"**. The decline in aging is not linear but occurs through "catabolic crises" (e.g., falls, bed rest due to illness), from which individuals may not fully recover. Maintaining muscle health is crucial to mitigate these crises.

Dr. Lyon emphasises that skeletal muscle is the **only organ system we have voluntary control over**, making us responsible for leveraging it through proper nutrition and exercise. This conscious effort is key to unlocking muscle's profound benefits for health span, lifespan, and what Dr. Lyon calls **"muscle span"**.
