# **Optimal Nutrition & Supplementation for Fitness**

This discussion, part of the Huberman Lab Guest Series, focuses on **nutrition and supplementation to maximise fitness, exercise, and performance goals**. There has been a significant transformation in the public's view of supplementation and nutrition in recent years, with many now recognising supplements as potent compounds that can transform performance, aid recovery, and acutely shape brain chemistry and hormone patterns. While some supplements are excellent, others are ineffective or even harmful, often due to side effects or high cost.

### **The Role of Supplements and Foundational Principles**

Supplements can work by allowing the consumption of nutrients in extremely high concentrations, which would not typically be found in nature through food. However, it is crucial to first **focus on the basics: sleep, nutrition, and hydration**. Taking supplements in high concentrations can also be unproductive, destructive, or counterproductive, potentially cancelling out the benefits of other supplements. Ideally, supplementation would be highly precise, based on extensive biological testing like blood, saliva, urine, and stool analysis, along with in-depth analysis of the gut microbiome, stress patterns, and cortisol curves. However, as this level of precision is not feasible for most people, general recommendations are provided.

### **Prioritising Supplements: The 80/20 Rule**

Dr. Andy Galpin suggests an "80/20 rule," focusing on the 20% of supplements that offer 80% of the benefit for the lowest cost, suitable for the general public. These supplements can aid:

* **Muscle growth and fat loss** (non-hormonal based).  
* **Energy and physical performance** (from squatting more to feeling better in yoga or having more energy throughout the day).  
* **Longevity**.

These categories include "fuel," "stimulants," and "fatigue blockers".

### **Creatine: The Top Recommendation**

**Creatine monohydrate** is consistently ranked as the number one supplement.

* **Benefits:** It has extensive research supporting its benefits for **muscle performance and strength**, bone mineral density, and a host of cognitive factors including memory, executive function, mood, and potential effects on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The brain uses creatine as a fuel, similar to skeletal muscle contraction. It also aids **recovery from muscle damage** and can potentially aid fat loss.  
* **Dosage & Side Effects:** Typically, 3 to 5 grams per day of creatine monohydrate is recommended, with extremely low side effects for most people. High doses (e.g., 30 grams) can pull fluid into the intestines, causing gastric distress.  
* **Loading Phase:** A loading phase (15-25 grams/day for a period, then reducing) is unnecessary for most individuals unless rapid saturation is required (e.g., in military scenarios with short preparation times). Consistent intake over 3-4 weeks will achieve full saturation.  
* **Mechanism:** Creatine works via the phosphocreatine system, which is vitally important for both muscle and forebrain function (planning, action, rule-switching).  
* **Cost & Effect:** Despite recent price increases, creatine remains relatively affordable with an excellent return on investment. It is a **chronic supplement**, meaning its positive effects accumulate over several weeks as it needs to be stored in tissue; it is not an acute stimulant. It is categorised as a "fuel" supplement.

### **Hydration: A Foundational Aspect**

Hydration is a fundamental aspect of nutrition and supplementation for performance, crucial for both **mental and physical performance**.

* **The Problem with Over-Gulping Water:** Chugging large amounts of water (e.g., 16 ounces all at once) causes rapid expansion of blood volume, leading to quick excretion and dilution of electrolytes. Sipping water slowly is generally better for absorption.  
* **Alkaline Water:** Worrying about the alkalinity of water is largely irrelevant compared to optimising other, more fundamental aspects of health.  
* **Impact of Dehydration:**  
  * As little as **2% body weight reduction due to dehydration** can reduce accuracy in physical performance (e.g., basketball shooting) and significantly increase the perception of exercise difficulty.  
  * 3-5% dehydration can significantly reduce blood volume, making blood viscous and impacting endurance, speed, and power.  
* **Impact of Over-Hydration (Hyponatremia):**  
  * Drinking too much pure water can dilute blood electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), leading to **hyponatremia** (low sodium concentration).  
  * Symptoms of hyponatremia (brain fog, confusion, performance decrements, irritation, GI distress) can be identical to dehydration, leading people to mistakenly drink more water and worsen the problem.  
  * An anecdote highlighted a CEO whose brain fog, sleep problems, and poor focus were due to consuming 250-260 ounces of water daily at 170 lbs body weight.  
* **Electrolytes:** Proper functioning of cells and neurons critically relies on the correct ratios of sodium, magnesium, and potassium.  
  * People on clean diets, those who exercise, or consume caffeine may not get enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium.  
  * **Caffeine can increase sodium secretion**.  
  * Carbohydrates also hold water, so a lower-carb diet can lead to more urination and lower hydration.  
  * Salt appetite can be a good guide for sodium intake, but individuals with prehypertension/hypertension should consult a medical specialist.

#### **Hydration Diagnostics:**

* **Sweat Observation:** White residue on clothing can indicate a heavy salt sweater.  
* **Body Weight Change:** Weighing yourself naked before and after a workout provides an accurate measure of fluid loss.  
* **Blood Chemistry:** Acute markers like hemoglobin and hematocrit (if high) and chronic markers like albumin can indicate hydration status.  
* **"WUT" System:** **W**eight, **U**rine color, and **T**hirst are simple, effective indicators of hydration status.

#### **Hydration Recommendations:**

* **General Daily Intake:** Roughly **half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight** for basal needs (e.g., 100 ounces for a 200lb person). This does not account for exercise-induced water loss.  
* **Exercise Replacement:** Aim to drink back **125% of the fluids lost during physical activity**. Typical loss during an hour of exercise in moderate conditions is 1-2 pounds, but can be much higher in hot environments or for elite athletes.  
* **Galpin Equation for Intra-Workout Hydration:**  
  * **In pounds/ounces:** Body weight (lbs) / 30 \= ounces of fluid every 15-20 minutes.  
  * **In metric:** 2 millilitres per kilogram of body weight every 15-20 minutes.  
  * Sip fluids consistently rather than chugging.  
* **Fluid Composition:** During intense or long workouts, consume **iso-osmotic fluids** (similar concentration to sweat). A good range is 200-400 mg of sodium, typically with a 2:1 or 3:1 sodium-to-potassium ratio. Coconut water with a pinch of salt is a good natural option.  
* **Avoiding Night Urination:** Drinking too much water right before bed can disrupt sleep. Sip water during the 3 hours preceding sleep, rather than gulping. Waking up multiple times to urinate (nocturia) can indicate a sleep disorder or excessive hydration. Dry mouth at night can also indicate mouth breathing, not necessarily dehydration.

#### **Galpin's Five-Step Cheater Guide for Optimising Hydration:**

1. **Drink a lot of water first thing in the morning:** Kickstarts the day, reduces the need to drink as much later, and prevents night-time fluid intake.  
2. **Eat mostly real, whole foods:** Fruits (e.g., watermelon is 95%+ water), vegetables, and even meat contain significant fluid, contributing substantially to overall hydration. Processed foods are often dehydrated and highly salted.  
3. **Pre-hydrate before workouts:** Consume 400-500 ml (13-20 ounces) in the hour before training, or 5-8 ounces 15-20 minutes before. Avoid drinking a lot of water seconds before exercise to prevent stomach discomfort.  
4. **Maintain hydration during workouts:** Use the Galpin equation for consistent fluid intake.  
5. **Rehydrate post-workout:** Replace 125% of the fluid lost during the session, accounting for any fluid consumed during the workout.

### **Training in the Fasted State**

The question of training fasted depends on whether the exercise bout will be limited by fuel availability.

* **Short, maximal exertion bouts** (e.g., 30 seconds) do not require pre-fuelling.  
* For **longer or higher-intensity training**, if glycogen stores (from previous day's carbohydrate intake) are topped off, training fasted is often fine.  
* **Total macronutrient intake throughout the day is generally more important than timing**, especially for protein. However, **carbohydrate timing is crucial for muscle glycogen resynthesis** if training multiple times a day or daily.  
* While many athletes can train fasted, it is generally **not optimal for enhancing performance** at the highest levels. The key distinction is "can I do it?" versus "is it optimal?".

### **Stimulants for Performance**

* **Caffeine:**  
  * Has a proven **ergogenic (performance-enhancing) effect**.  
  * Recommended dosage is **1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight** approximately 30 minutes prior to exercise.  
  * It enhances **endurance, reaction time, and power output**.  
  * Too much caffeine (over 5 mg/kg body weight) can actually **degrade performance**.  
  * Caffeine works by competitively binding to adenosine receptors, preventing adenosine (a byproduct of energy expenditure that induces sleepiness) from doing so.  
  * Tolerance can develop, but even regular users still see benefits.  
  * Be mindful of caffeine's half-life (4-6 hours) to avoid disrupting sleep.  
  * Commercial coffee caffeine content varies wildly and can be very high (250-500mg), leading to headaches or jitters if intake is inconsistent or too high.  
  * Delaying caffeine intake by 90-120 minutes after waking on non-training days can help clear morning adenosine.  
* **Non-Stimulant Options:**  
  * **Nitric Oxide Pathway Enhancers (e.g., Beetroot, Citrulline, Arginine):** These compounds (especially beetroot extract) enhance vasodilation, improving nutrient transport and having an ergogenic effect, particularly for moderate to longer-duration endurance performance. They are not stimulants and won't disrupt sleep. **Caution:** Activation of the arginine pathway can exacerbate oral cold sores in predisposed individuals.  
  * **Nootropics (e.g., Alpha GPC):** Substances that enhance brain function. Alpha GPC (300-600mg) can improve focus and alertness, useful for challenging training sessions or when caloric restriction might otherwise impair mental sharpness. While not a traditional stimulant, it can promote alertness.

### **Fatigue Reducers**

* **Rhodiola Rosea:** Has research showing slight to moderate improvements in power output, fatigue resistance, antioxidant effects, and endurance performance. It is also helpful in managing cortisol.  
  * **Caution:** Suppressing already low cortisol levels can worsen lethargy and lack of desire. High-quality sourcing is important as it often comes in blends.  
* **Beta Alanine:** Needs to be taken consistently to build up carnosine in muscles, which acts as an acid buffer to help with fatigue management. It can cause a skin tingling sensation (paresthesia), which can be mitigated by starting with lower dosages (e.g., 2g) and gradually increasing.

### **Supplement Sourcing and Use Principles**

* **Single Ingredient Formulations:** **Highly recommended** to determine what works for you, control dosage, and troubleshoot potential side effects. This is the best way to build a rational supplementation approach and make adjustments. It also helps ensure the amount on the label is accurate.  
* **Third-Party Certification:** **Crucial for quality and accurate dosing**, especially for athletes undergoing drug testing, but beneficial for everyone to avoid wildly inconsistent concentrations of active ingredients.  
* **Cost and Blends:** Blends often contain less of the more expensive, effective ingredients.  
* **Dependency and Supplement Holidays:**  
  * The **ultimate goal is physiological resilience**, where minimal or no supplementation is required, relying on foundational habits like sleep, nutrition, and stress management.  
  * Some supplements, like creatine and beta-alanine, require consistent use for benefit. Others can be used as needed for specific sessions (e.g., Alpha GPC, Rhodiola).  
  * Distinguish between **physiological dependency** (e.g., caffeine) and **psychological preference** or habit.  
  * Supplements can be used for **short-term symptom management**, but they should not cover up underlying causal problems (e.g., poor sleep hygiene, stress, poor hydration). "Better living through chemistry still requires better living".  
  * **Prioritise behavioural tools and good nutrition first**. Using supplements to mask problems can prevent individuals from addressing the root cause.

### **Recovery and Anti-inflammatories**

Recovery is distinct from adaptation; **adaptation occurs after recovery**.

* **Fitness-Fatigue Model:** Performance is maximised when fitness is high and fatigue is low. Reducing fatigue can lead to significant performance improvements.  
* **Tapering/Deloading:** A **50% reduction in training volume over about a week for every eight weeks of hard training** can reduce fatigue and improve performance by 3-8% without reducing fitness. Intensity, frequency, and duration of the taper should be maintained. This allows the body to recover and actualise training adaptations.

#### **Three-Step Recovery Process:**

1. **Inflammation (Immediate, Seconds to Hours Post-Training):**  
   * This initial phase is a **necessary part of the repair process**, bringing fluid, enhancing blood flow, and removing waste.  
   * **Crucially, avoid anti-inflammatories** (supplements, prescription/over-the-counter drugs, ice baths) during this immediate window, as they can blunt the adaptive response.  
   * **Supplements for later/chronic use:**  
     * **Omega-3 fatty acids:** 2-5 grams total (typically 1:1 EPA to DHA ratio) can be beneficial, but excessive amounts (e.g., 15g) can harm the immune response.  
     * **Curcumin:** 500mg three times a day. A potent anti-inflammatory, but sensitive individuals may experience a reduction in DHT, leading to decreased libido and drive. These effects are reversible upon cessation.  
     * Ginger and Boswellia may also have some inflammatory benefits.  
2. **Proliferation ("Cleanup Crew"):**  
   * This stage involves clearing out dead cells, debris, and misfolded proteins.  
   * **Glutamine:** 20 grams per day (e.g., 10g morning, 10g night) is a conditionally essential amino acid that supports this process. It has a low risk of side effects, as the body can convert it if not needed for muscle recovery. There's anecdotal and some peer-reviewed interest in its role for leaky gut and reducing sugar cravings. Gastric distress can occur at very high doses but can be mitigated by gradual increase.  
3. **Remodeling (Growing Back Bigger and Stronger):**  
   * This is where the majority of tissue repair and growth occurs.  
   * **Caloric Intake:** During recovery from injury or intense soreness, **increase caloric intake by approximately 10%** to support the increased basal metabolic rate. This prioritises faster recovery over minor fat gain.  
   * **Macronutrients:**  
     * **Protein:** Aim for **1 gram or more per pound of body weight**. This provides the necessary amino acids for tissue repair and growth.  
     * **Carbohydrates:** Do not reduce carbohydrate intake, as they are needed to stimulate insulin, which is anabolic and drives nutrients into tissue, and for muscle glycogen resynthesis.  
     * **Fats:** Maintain current fat intake; avoid extreme changes.  
   * **Micronutrients:**  
     * A **basic multivitamin** can cover foundational needs.  
     * Specific micronutrients include **Vitamin A and Zinc**.  
     * **Magnesium:** Around 6 mg per kilogram of body weight (magnesium citrate is well-researched, though other forms may also be effective).  
     * Calcium (especially for bone injuries) and Vitamin D are also beneficial.  
   * **Tart Cherry Juice:** Effective for muscle soreness and may aid sleep.

### **Sleep Optimisation: The Foundation**

**Sleep is the most powerful performance-enhancing activity**, fundamentally impacting mental, physical, and emotional health and performance.

* **Importance:** Quality sleep raises the baseline level of functioning and resilience. During sleep, the body undergoes various forms of metabolism.  
* **Diagnosis:** While professional clinical-grade sleep studies are ideal (e.g., Absolute Rest), wearable trackers are improving.  
* **Four-Fold System to Address Sleep Issues:**  
  1. **Biology:** Assess neurotransmitter concentrations, vitamins (B6, B12), and cortisol/DHEA ratios through saliva and blood tests.  
  2. **Environment:** Conduct a full environmental scan of the bedroom. Key factors include:  
     * **Cleanliness:** Wash sheets weekly to reduce allergens.  
     * **Pets:** Keeping pets out of the bedroom can reduce dander.  
     * **Light & Temperature:** Maintain consistent darkness and a cool environment. Avoid AC/heater cycling that disrupts sleep stages.  
     * **Air Quality:** Ensure good ventilation to prevent CO2 buildup, which can disrupt sleep.  
     * **Negative Ionisation:** Higher negative ion concentrations (found near coasts, can be replicated with machines or simple methods) may improve sleep.  
  3. **Psychology:** Address underlying anxiety, depression, or other psychological factors affecting sleep.  
  4. **Sleep Pathology:** Identify specific sleep disorders through eye tracking and other methods.

#### **Practical Sleep Tips:**

* **Jet Lag:** Use apps like "Time Shifter" for light, stimulant, food, and hydration protocols when travelling.  
* **Acid Reflux:** Elevate the head of the bed by 6 inches.  
* **Snoring:** Try mouth taping. If persistent, explore myofunctional therapy (tongue exercises) to strengthen tongue muscles and prevent airway obstruction, especially helpful for REM sleep issues.  
* **Bed Environment:** Condition the bed for only two activities: **sex and sleep**. Avoid other activities (reading, screen time) in bed to reinforce its association with rest.  
* **Sleeping with a Partner:** Can negatively impact sleep quality. Using two smaller beds pushed together or separate sheets may help.  
* **Orthosomnia:** Avoid obsessive tracking of sleep scores on wearables, as anticipating good scores can lead to earlier awakenings. Do not check sleep scores for at least the first 60 minutes after waking.  
* **Phone Use at Night:** Use "Night Mode," "Do Not Disturb," or "Airplane Mode." Set phone to black and white and disable notifications to minimise sleep disruption if you must check it.  
* **Inositol (Myo-inositol):** 900 milligrams before sleep can aid falling back asleep, particularly for those on lower-carbohydrate diets or fasting for longer periods before bed.  
* **Reveri App:** A sleep hypnosis app (8-11 minutes once a week) that can significantly improve sleep quality, including falling and staying asleep. This is a behavioural tool that taps into physiology.  
* **Getting Up to Complete Tasks:** If a project or idea causes significant anxiety preventing sleep, occasionally getting up to complete the 10-15 minute task can alleviate anxiety, potentially allowing for sleep or at least productive time. This should be used sparingly.

### **Additional Topics and Questions**

* **Intermittent Fasting & Keto for Muscle Gain:** Currently, there is insufficient scientific data to conclusively answer whether one can gain muscle mass while combining intermittent fasting and a ketogenic diet.  
* **GABA Supplements:** Experts generally do not recommend or spend much time on GABA supplements, as they are rarely needed.  
* **Weight Training Fasted and Delayed Eating:** If overall daily protein intake is sufficient, it is likely acceptable to train fasted and delay eating for 3-4 hours post-workout.  
* **Carbohydrate Cycling/Loading:** Carbohydrate loading can benefit long-duration endurance, ideally over 3-4 days of gradual increase, rather than a single large meal. Different carbohydrate types like glucose and fructose use separate transporters, allowing for higher total carbohydrate intake during exercise.  
* **Branch-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) and Essential Amino Acids (EAAs):** Generally considered "meh" if total daily protein intake is adequate. If protein intake is insufficient, EAAs would be preferred over BCAAs. They can be used pre/mid/post training in some circumstances, with little harm other than cost.  
* **The "Anabolic Window":** The **post-exercise anabolic window is extremely real** in the sense that the body is highly sensitised to nutrients, and quick rehydration, muscle glycogen replenishment, and tissue rebuilding post-exercise are crucial for recovery. However, for protein synthesis, total daily protein intake is more important than consuming protein within a precise 30-60 minute window. Carbohydrate timing, though, is very important, especially for those training multiple times a day.  
* **Garlic for Performance:** Some limited human data suggest garlic extract may aid recovery from injury or tissue damage, but general immune-boosting claims can be vague and potentially counterproductive during specific recovery phases.  
* **Tart Cherry Extract:** Effective for muscle soreness and may aid sleep.

### **Conclusion of the Series**

The discussions highlighted that **science is a verb, meaning it is ongoing and constantly changing**; therefore, all recommendations should be used as guidelines. The series provided actionable knowledge, often counterintuitive but logically explained, covering fitness assessment, strength, speed, hypertrophy, endurance training, optimal program design, and recovery. The importance of foundational behaviours (sleep, stress management, physical activity, hydration, whole food nutrition) as the basis for performance was consistently emphasised.
