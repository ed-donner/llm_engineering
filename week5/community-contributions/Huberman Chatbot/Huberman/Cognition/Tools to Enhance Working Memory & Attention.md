# **Tools to Enhance Working Memory & Attention**

This response will explain what working memory is, differentiate it from other forms of memory, discuss its underlying biology and neurochemistry, describe how it can be tested, and outline various tools and protocols to improve it.

### **Understanding Working Memory**

Working memory is a unique category of memory that allows individuals to **hold small amounts of information in their mind for short periods**. It is inherently linked to attention, meaning that understanding and improving working memory can significantly benefit focus and attention. Working memory is essential for navigating immediate environments and sequencing actions throughout one's day, from waking up to going to sleep. For instance, remembering to make coffee, put on shoes, and hydrate before a run involves working memory, allowing you to sequence these actions and then discard the sequence once completed.

People with diminished or entirely lacking working memory face extreme difficulties in sequencing activities and require substantial assistance in their daily lives. This highlights the critical importance of robust working memory for adaptive and functional living.

### **Working Memory Compared to Other Memory Forms**

To fully grasp working memory, it's helpful to compare it with other, more commonly understood forms of memory:

* **Long-Term Memory**: This refers to our ability to recall facts about ourselves or the world (declarative memories) and perform learned actions without conscious thought (procedural memories), such as remembering state capitals or riding a bicycle. Long-term memories are stored in a distributed way across neural networks. The **hippocampus** (a brain structure shaped like a seahorse, with one on each side of the brain) is **essential for the formation and storage of long-term memories**. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to difficulties in accessing or forming long-term memories.  
* **Short-Term Memory**: This is a temporary memory bank for information that may or may not be passed into long-term memory. For example, when you learn something new, the information is first held in short-term memory for a few minutes to a few hours. Only a fraction of this information is then transferred to long-term memory. The **hippocampus is also implicated in the passage of short-term memories into long-term memories**.

A key distinction between working memory and short/long-term memory lies in **neuroplasticity**, the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. Neuroplasticity involves:

* **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**: The strengthening of connections between neurons due to their repeated, close-in-time firing. This makes communication between neurons more robust.  
* **Long-Term Depression (LTD)**: The weakening or removal of connections (synapses) between neurons.  
* Both LTP and LTD are crucial for forming and removing (forgetting) short-term and long-term memories.  
* **Neurogenesis**: The formation of new neurons. While exciting, especially in the adult brain, the total amount of neurogenesis is **infinitesimally small** as a mechanism for neuroplasticity and learning compared to LTP and LTD.

In stark contrast, **working memory, as far as current understanding goes, does not involve neuroplasticity**. Instead, it reflects a neural circuit repeatedly running an algorithm for different types of information, which is then intentionally discarded once no longer needed. This ability to remember information for just as long as required and then discard it is a hallmark of working memory.

### **Testing Working Memory Capacity**

Working memory capacity can be assessed through specific tasks. The podcast provides two audio-based tests:

1. **Letter Recall Test**: You were asked to remember strings of letters (e.g., "J K Z P I"). The purpose was to illustrate how working memory holds information temporarily. Despite being easy to recall initially, subsequent information and time usually lead to the rapid discarding of these letters from working memory, often forgotten within minutes.  
2. **Sentence Final Word Recall Test**: You listened to six sentences and were asked to recall the final word of each. Your performance on this test helps determine your working memory span (low, moderate, or high). For this discussion, a recall of **three to six final words correctly indicates a high working memory span**, while **one or two (or zero) indicates a low working memory span**.

Your performance on these tasks provides an indication of your baseline working memory capacity and, by extension, **the likely levels of dopamine available for release in your prefrontal cortex**.

### **The Neurobiology and Neurochemistry of Working Memory**

Working memory relies on the collaboration of many neural networks, but some key hubs are particularly important:

* **Prefrontal Cortex**: This area is located just behind the forehead.  
* **Dopamine-Manufacturing Neurons**: These neurons are found in the brain stem and send their connections (axons) up to the prefrontal cortex. This connection is often referred to as the **mesocortical circuitry**.

**Dopamine is the dominant neuromodulator regulating working memory capacity**. The amount of dopamine released in the prefrontal cortex directly influences whether working memory performance is high, medium, or low. Research has shown:

* Individuals with a **high working memory span tend to have more dopamine available for release** in the frontal cortex.  
* Conversely, those with a **low working memory span have less dopamine available for release**.  
* Studies where small amounts of dopamine were directly introduced into the frontal cortex demonstrated a **straightforward increase in the number of items individuals could remember**, implying dopamine is a "capacity limiting neuromodulator".  
* **However, it is crucial to understand that more dopamine does not always equate to improved working memory**. The relationship between dopamine and working memory follows an **inverted U-shaped function**. This means:  
  * Low dopamine leads to short working memory span.  
  * Increasing dopamine improves working memory.  
  * But **increasing dopamine too much can actually degrade working memory performance**, sometimes even below baseline levels.

Working memory and attention involve two critical aspects supported by dopamine projections:

1. **Eliminating Distractors**: The ability to ignore irrelevant information in one's environment is largely due to dopamine neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex.  
2. **Task Switching and Context Switching**: The ability to shift attention between different tasks or interleave them (e.g., tying shoes while talking on the phone) is largely dependent on dopamine projections to the **basal ganglia**, a brain structure involved in generating and stopping movements.

### **Tools to Enhance Working Memory**

There are various behavioural, supplemental, and pharmacological approaches to improve working memory, often by modulating dopamine levels:

#### **Behavioural Tools (Zero-Cost)**

These methods are generally low-risk and can significantly increase dopamine:

* **Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) / Yoga Nidra**:  
  * NSDR is a term coined by Andrew Huberman, derived from the ancient practice of Yoga Nidra ("yoga sleep").  
  * These protocols involve lying down and listening to an audio script that guides you through long exhale breathing and deliberate muscle relaxation. The goal is to remain awake but reach a shallow sleep pattern, though falling asleep can sometimes occur.  
  * Research shows that **performing a Yoga Nidra protocol can increase baseline dopamine levels in the basal ganglia by as much as 60%**.  
  * **Improvements in cognitive performance tasks with a working memory element have been observed** following NSDR/Yoga Nidra.  
  * Scripts for NSDR and Yoga Nidra are freely available on platforms like YouTube. **20 to 30 minutes is a good starting duration**.  
* **Deliberate Cold Exposure**:  
  * Getting into cold water (e.g., cold plunge, cold shower, cold ocean) can significantly **increase circulating catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine**. This increase can last for several hours.  
  * Many people report feeling a shift in mind and body after cold exposure, including increased focus and alertness, which can reduce the need for caffeine.  
  * For working memory enhancement, a **cold shower 30 to 60 minutes prior to a working memory task** could be beneficial.  
  * For cold water immersion, temperatures from low 40s to low 60s Fahrenheit (around 4-15Â°C) are used, with durations typically from **30 seconds to 3 minutes** for frequent exposure. The ideal temperature is one that allows safe immersion for this duration but is uncomfortable enough to require mental effort to stay in.  
  * **Crucially, never combine breathwork or breath holding with deliberate cold exposure due to the risk of fainting or death**.

#### **Other Non-Pharmacological Approaches**

* **Binaural Beats**:  
  * Listening to sounds of different frequencies in each ear (typically via headphones) can cause the brain to "entrain" or follow a particular frequency, influencing neural circuits.  
  * Studies have shown **small to moderate, but significant, improvements in working memory performance**.  
  * **40 Hz binaural beats** have been linked to general cognitive performance and working memory.  
  * **15 Hz binaural beats** have shown improvements in visual spatial working memory.  
  * While the direct relationship between binaural beats and dopamine isn't fully understood from these studies, they offer a zero-cost, non-pharmacologic way to potentially improve working memory.

#### **Supplement-Based Approaches**

It is **critical to consult with your healthcare provider** before adding or removing any supplement. Start with the minimal effective dose for any supplement.

* **L-Tyrosine**:  
  * An amino acid that is a **precursor to dopamine**.  
  * Studies suggest that L-tyrosine supplementation can **improve working memory, particularly in multitasking environments**.  
  * Doses used in studies have been very high (e.g., 150 mg per kilogram of body weight), which is generally not recommended due to potential side effects like feeling a "crash" a few hours later.  
  * A more reasonable starting dose would be **250 to 500 milligrams** to assess individual response.  
* **Mucuna Pruriens**:  
  * A velvety bean that contains L-DOPA, a **key component in the biochemical pathway leading to dopamine production**.  
  * It is a potent dopamine increaser and has been used to increase dopamine levels in Parkinson's patients.  
  * Dosages in studies range from 1 to 5 grams. Given its potency, a **very low starting dose (e.g., 250 to 500 milligrams)** is advised, and **doctor consultation is absolutely essential**.

#### **Prescription Pharmacology**

These require a prescription and medical supervision, especially due to the inverted U-shaped function of dopamine on working memory (too much can be detrimental).

* **Bromocriptine**:  
  * A **dopamine agonist** that increases dopamine levels.  
  * Studies show it can **significantly improve working memory in individuals with initially low baseline dopamine** and shorter working memory spans.  
  * However, in individuals with an already high working memory span, bromocriptine **did not improve performance at low/moderate doses, and at high doses, it actually degraded performance**. This demonstrates the inverted U-shaped function in practice.  
  * It has been prescribed off-label for conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI), neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Parkinson's), and ADHD, which often involve working memory deficits.  
* **ADHD Medications (e.g., Adderall, Ritalin)**:  
  * These drugs increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels and are known to improve cognitive performance, including working memory.  
  * **Modafinil** is another category of drug known to improve cognitive performance in some cases.  
  * While effective for many, particularly in individuals with ADHD, these drugs should be discussed thoroughly with a physician, especially for children.

It is important to remember that **behavioural tools, nutritional tools, and supplement-based tools can work synergistically with prescription drugs** to improve working memory and focus, sometimes allowing for reduced drug dosages. Better living through chemistry still requires better living, emphasizing the importance of a multi-faceted approach.

In conclusion, working memory is a vital brain function for navigating daily life and managing attention. Fortunately, a range of zero-cost, low-cost, and prescription-based tools are available to enhance this incredible cognitive capacity.
