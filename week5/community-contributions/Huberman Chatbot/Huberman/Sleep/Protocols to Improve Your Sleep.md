### **Optimising Your Sleep: Protocols and Tools**

Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosts Dr. Matthew Walker in a series dedicated to sleep. This episode focuses on the "dos and do nots" of sleep, offering science-based tools to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep, addressing factors like light, temperature, alcohol, caffeine, and cannabis. The ultimate goal is to optimise sleep based on the **QQR formula: Quality, Quantity, Regularity, and Timing**.

#### **The Five Edicts of Sleep Hygiene**

Dr. Matthew Walker outlines five fundamental principles, or "edicts," of sleep hygiene that can be implemented immediately to improve sleep:

1. **Regularity is King**

   * **Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day**, regardless of whether it's a weekday or the weekend.  
   * **Why**: This consistent timing trains your brain, anchoring your sleep and improving both its quantity and quality by training your central 24-hour circadian clock.  
2. **Darkness at Night, Light in the Morning**

   * **Evening Darkness**: In the last hour before bed, **dim down 50% or more of the lights in your home**. This can surprisingly make you feel sleepy. Melatonin, often called the "hormone of darkness," is released when the brain receives the signal of darkness, acting as a "brake pedal" for wakefulness. Using an eye mask and blackout curtains is also recommended. Very little artificial light can disrupt your circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin in the evening. Light from candles or fireplaces is generally acceptable.  
   * **Morning Light**: Exposure to **bright light in the morning** (especially sunlight or SAD lamps of 5,000-10,000 Lux) helps reapply the "brake" on melatonin, signalling wakefulness. It significantly **increases the amplitude of the morning cortisol spike** by as much as 50%, which is desirable for elevated mood, focus, alertness, and reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms throughout the day. The visual system that sets circadian rhythm is less sensitive in the morning, requiring a lot of bright light to effectively wake up the system and shut down sleepiness signals. Conversely, later in the day, very little light can be disruptive.  
3. **Temperature**

   * **Keep your sleep environment cool**, ideally around **18.5째C (67째F)**.  
   * **Why**: You need to drop your core body and brain temperature by a little less than 1째C (2-3째F) to get to sleep and stay asleep. Your body achieves this by pushing blood to the surface of your skin, particularly your hands and feet, which are highly vascular. Warmer hands and feet facilitate this heat release from the core, helping you fall asleep faster.  
   * **Protocols**: You can wear thick socks or use a hot water bottle for your feet to aid in this process, as long as the ambient room temperature remains cool.  
4. **Walk It Out**

   * **Do not stay in bed for long periods of time awake**. If you can't fall asleep or return to sleep within **about 20-25 minutes**, **get out of bed**.  
   * **Why**: Your brain is highly associative, and staying in bed while awake trains it to link your bed with wakefulness rather than sleep.  
   * **Protocols**: Go to a different room, ideally in dim light, and engage in a relaxing activity like reading a book or listening to a podcast. **Avoid checking email or eating**, as these activities can further train your brain to be awake. Only return to bed when you feel sleepy. The goal is to **relearn the association of your bed with sleepiness**.  
5. **Be Mindful of Alcohol and Caffeine**

   * **Caffeine**:  
     * **Cut off caffeine at least 10 hours before you expect to go to bed**. Caffeine has a **half-life of 5-6 hours** (meaning 50% is still in your system) and a **quarter-life of 10-12 hours**.  
     * **Why**: Caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep and keeps you in a shallower state of non-REM sleep, making it easier to wake up and harder to fall back asleep. Consuming caffeine too late can significantly reduce deep sleep (by 15-20%).  
     * **Protocols**: The speaker's ideal intake is a high peak early in the day, tapering off by early afternoon. Decaffeinated coffee is an option if you enjoy the taste.  
   * **Alcohol**:  
     * Alcohol is **not a sleep aid**; it is a **sedative**, and sedation is not natural sleep.  
     * **Why**: Alcohol fragments sleep with unremembered awakenings, leaving you feeling unrestored. Crucially, it is a **potent blocker of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep**, which is essential for learning, memory, creativity, and emotional regulation. When alcohol use is stopped, people often experience a "REM sleep rebound" with vivid dreams due to accumulated sleep debt. Even a single glass of wine in the afternoon can compromise sleep quality. The negative effects are thought to be due to metabolic byproducts like aldehydes.  
     * **Protocols**: Generally, none is best for optimal sleep. If consuming alcohol, be aware of the trade-off and avoid making it a habit of multiple nights a week.  
   * **Food**:  
     * The dogma of avoiding food 3-4 hours before bed might be too extreme for many. Data suggests that eating **2 hours or even 90 minutes before bed** may not necessarily harm sleep for most people, though **45 minutes or less before bed could lead to deterioration**.  
     * **Why**: Eating too close to bedtime can cause discomfort, and lying down increases the risk of gastric reflux and heartburn. High sugar and low protein diets can worsen sleep by subtly increasing core body temperature. Some evidence suggests **carbohydrates in the evening** might help sleep by boosting melatonin precursors like tryptophan and serotonin. Your body's ability to dispose of sugar is generally worse in the evening.  
     * **Protocols**: Experiment to find what works best for you. There isn't yet enough data to recommend a specific "sleep diet" for improved optimisation.  
   * **THC and CBD (Cannabis)**  
     * **THC**: While it can help you fall asleep faster, it leads to **tolerance and dependency** requiring higher doses. More critically, it is very good at **blocking your REM sleep**. Upon cessation, users often experience a "vicious insomnia withdrawal syndrome". The speaker does not currently recommend THC for sleep.  
     * **CBD**: Data is mixed but shows some potential benefit. It appears to act as an **anxiolytic (anxiety reducer)**, indirectly promoting sleep by reducing stress. It might also be **hypothermic**, dropping core body temperature, which aids sleep. CBD may have a **U-shaped function**, meaning doses below 25mg might be wake-promoting, while **50mg and above** seem sleep-promoting. Due to lack of regulation, third-party lab testing is advised for products.

#### **Unconventional and Advanced Sleep Enhancement Protocols**

Beyond the basics, several other protocols can significantly enhance sleep:

* **"Do Nothing" After a Bad Night of Sleep**

  * If you've had a poor night's sleep, **do not sleep in later, do not go to bed earlier, do not increase caffeine intake, and do not nap during the day**.  
  * **Why**: Sleeping in delays the build-up of adenosine (sleepiness chemical), making it harder to fall asleep at your normal time the next night. Going to bed earlier can lead to more time awake in bed, reinforcing negative associations. Napping removes built-up sleepiness, similarly making night-time sleep harder. This strategy aims to prevent a "vicious cycle" of disrupted sleep.  
  * **Helpful exception**: **Morning exercise**, even after partial sleep deprivation, can help offset blood glucose dysregulation caused by poor sleep.  
* **Limit Time in Bed (Bedtime Rescheduling / Sleep Restriction Therapy)**

  * This is a highly validated psychological intervention for insomnia, often part of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).  
  * **Protocol**: Under supervision, drastically **limit your time in bed** (e.g., to 5 hours initially). The wakeup time remains fixed, but the "to bed" time is delayed.  
  * **Why**: This "brute force ruthless efficiency" creates a short-term sleep debt, forcing the brain to be more efficient when sleep occurs, reducing awakenings and time awake in bed. Gradually, as sleep quality improves, the sleep window is titrated back to normal. This process helps individuals regain "sleep confidence".  
* **Implement a Wind-Down Routine**

  * Sleep is not like a light switch but rather like landing a plane, requiring gradual deceleration.  
  * **Protocol**: Engage in any relaxing activity you enjoy before bed, such as listening to a podcast, reading a book, meditating, or light stretching.  
* **Do Not Count Sheep / Try a Mental Walk**

  * Counting sheep actually makes it harder to fall asleep.  
  * **Alternative**: Try taking yourself on a **detailed mental walk** of a very familiar route.  
  * **Why**: The high-fidelity detail of this visualisation gets your mind off anxious thoughts and onto a procedural task, which can facilitate sleep.  
* **Remove All Clock Faces from the Bedroom**

  * **Why**: Knowing the time when you're awake in bed creates "anticipatory anxiety" and only worsens the situation, making it harder to fall back asleep. This includes phones, which also bring a "tsunami of stress and anxiety" from social media and emails, and can lead to "fear of missing out" (FOMO).

#### **Sleep Optimization 3.0: Future and Cutting-Edge Tools**

Research is advancing in several areas to enhance sleep, moving beyond traditional methods:

* **Electrical Brain Stimulation (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation \- tDCS)**

  * **Method**: Applying small amounts of voltage to the brain through electrode pads to stimulate the cortex.  
  * **Effect**: Early studies showed it could **boost the electrical quality of deep sleep by about 60%** and **almost double the memory benefits** sleep provides.  
  * **Advanced Method**: **Closed-loop stimulation** is more effective. This involves measuring individual brain waves and timing electrical pulses precisely to match and amplify the brain's natural slow waves, leading to more reliable benefits in boosting deep sleep, memory, and sleep spindles.  
  * **Caution**: **Do not attempt DIY versions** due to safety risks.  
* **Thermal Manipulation**

  * **Scientific Basis**: Your core body temperature drops significantly as you prepare for and enter deep sleep.  
  * **Interventions**:  
    * **Accelerating Sleep Onset**: Warming peripheral regions like hands and feet (e.g., with a wet suit-like device) can accelerate the core temperature drop, helping individuals fall asleep 25% faster.  
    * **Increasing Deep Sleep and Reducing Awakenings**: Continuously cooling the core of the body during sleep can **increase deep sleep by 25-40 minutes** and significantly **reduce awakenings in older adults** (from 50% probability to 5%). Older adults have impaired thermoregulatory ability, making this especially effective for them.  
    * **Warm Bath Effect**: Taking a **warm bath or hot shower before bed** causes vasodilation at the skin surface, leading to a "thermal dump" of heat away from the core. This cools the body and promotes sounder sleep, increasing deep sleep by up to 40 minutes.  
  * **Future**: Developing portable foot-warming technology (e.g., socks) and integrating thermal regulation into mattresses. The principle is to **warm up to cool down to fall asleep, stay cool to stay asleep, and warm up to wake up**.  
* **Acoustic Stimulation**

  * **Method**: Playing sub-awakening level acoustic tones at a very slow frequency (e.g., less than one Hertz) to match the rhythm of slow brain waves.  
  * **Effect**: Can significantly increase the amount of deep sleep.  
  * **Advanced Method**: **Closed-loop acoustic stimulation** that precisely times tones to brain wave peaks can also improve memory. However, continuous stimulation can inhibit naturally occurring deep sleep waves, indicating the brain's internal checks and balances.  
  * **Noise Machines**: White noise machines have equivocal data, with no consistent robust effect, but might be beneficial in environments with high external sound pollution. Pink noise, which is enriched in slower sound frequencies, has shown some promise in increasing total sleep time and Stage 2 non-REM sleep.  
* **Kinesthetic Manipulation (Rocking)**

  * **Method**: Studies involved rocking a bed laterally at a very slow frequency (0.25 Hz).  
  * **Effect**: This motion **increased the speed of falling asleep, boosted deep sleep, increased sleep spindle oscillations, and provided a modest 10% memory improvement**.  
  * **Mechanism**: It works through the **vestibular system**, which senses motion and movement. It's theorised that rocking might help by compromising proprioceptive awareness (sense of body position relative to gravity), which is necessary to lose to fall asleep.

#### **Enhancing Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep**

While most methods target deep non-REM sleep, enhancing REM sleep is also crucial.

* **Thermal Manipulation for REM Sleep**

  * **Principle**: Achieving a **"thermo-neutral" point** (not too cold, not too hot) can boost REM sleep. Maintaining a slightly warmer body temperature than for deep sleep is important for REM.  
  * **Challenge**: Individual thermoregulation varies, requiring a closed-loop system for personalised thermal control.  
* **Newer Sleep Medications (DORAs)**

  * **DORAs (Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists)** are a new class of sleep medications.  
  * **Mechanism**: They **block orexin**, a brain chemical that acts like a "finger on the light switch" for wakefulness. By turning off the wakefulness signal, they allow for more naturalistic sleep.  
  * **Effect**: Unlike older sedative-hypnotic "Z-drugs" (e.g., Ambien) that can distort deep sleep and have safety concerns, DORAs appear to improve most aspects of sleep, **including REM sleep**. This is thought to be due to their indirect effect of boosting **acetylcholine**, a key neurotransmitter for REM sleep.  
  * **Current Status**: DORAs are expensive and not widely prescribed in the US due to insurance coverage issues.  
  * **Caution with supplements**: While increasing acetylcholine precursors (e.g., Alpha GPC) might seem logical, they can increase arousal or brute-force REM sleep too early at the cost of deep non-REM sleep. Similarly, serotonergic supplements might lead to deep sleep but disrupt later sleep phases. Peptides like Selank have been anecdotally reported to increase deep sleep but eliminate REM sleep, which is undesirable for overall sleep architecture.

The speaker emphasises that all advice is **scientifically descriptive**, not medically or lifestyle prescriptive, encouraging individuals to understand the science to make informed choices for their own well-being.
