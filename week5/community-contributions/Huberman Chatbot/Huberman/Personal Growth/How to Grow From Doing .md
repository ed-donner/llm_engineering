# How to Grow From Doing Hard Things | Michael Easter

Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Michael Easter.

## Introduction to Michael Easter

Michael Easter is a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a world-renowned writer. His recent work focuses on how modern conveniences undermine our mental and physical health, as well as the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly steps we can take to offset these damages. Michael's insights aim to help us grow and improve focus, engage in meaningful creative work, and build deeper connections with others.

One of the reasons Michael Easter is on this podcast is that his book, *The Comfort Crisis*, changed my daily life. It reshaped my understanding of how to view life’s challenges and rewards through the lens of dopamine management. His insights have motivated me to do hard things on a regular basis, transforming my mental health for the better.

## Key Concepts Discussed

### Modern Life vs. Ancient Nervous Systems

Michael and I explore the concept of how our ancient nervous systems are mismatched with modern conveniences. Humans evolved in a context of discomfort, requiring physical activity and social interaction for survival:

1. **Physical Activity**: People were physically active, averaging 20,000 steps a day while carrying various loads.
2. **Social Interaction**: Long periods of downtime allowed for face-to-face interaction, building relationships.
3. **Comfort vs. Growth**: Modern life offers comfort at the expense of mental resilience, leading many to seek easier paths rather than growing through challenges.

### Importance of Facing Discomfort

Both Michael and I highlight the significance of discomfort as a vehicle for growth. Engaging in difficult activities is beneficial:

1. **Mental Fortitude**: Doing hard things regularly can help strengthen mental resilience and increase overall happiness.
2. **Connection**: Embracing discomfort enhances our connections with others and deepens our sense of self.

### The Modern Convenience Crisis

Being constantly comfortable can lead to negative outcomes:

- **Addiction & Compulsion**: The convenience of modern society can perpetuate addiction to quick gratification, diminishing our overall satisfaction in life.
- **Mindful Choices**: It is crucial to make informed choices about how we engage with both physical and online worlds.

### Practical Steps for Improvement

Michael shares practical advice on how individuals can adapt these concepts to their daily lives:

1. **Make Small Discomforts a Habit**: Engage in actions that challenge you, even if minor, such as walking instead of driving or choosing stairs over elevators.
2. **Stay Active**: Regular physical activity, especially weighted walks, can enhance both physical and mental health.
3. **Cultivate Gratitude**: Develop a sense of gratitude toward life experiences and embrace the discomfort that often accompanies personal growth.

## The 2% Rule

Michael discusses the “2% Rule,” which states that only 2% of people opt for healthier choices (like taking the stairs) when given the option of a more comfortable choice. This highlights our intrinsic tendency to opt for convenience over effort.

### Misogi Concept

Another concept shared is the Japanese tradition of *misogi*, which involves undertaking a challenging task each year that pushes one’s boundaries. It’s a risky endeavor (with roughly a 50% chance of completion) but leads to invaluable lessons about resilience and personal growth.

## Michael's Personal Experiences

Through sharing his own adventures, Michael illustrates how facing physical and mental challenges has shaped his life:

- **Physical Challenges**: Michael discusses extended periods spent in nature, which have taught him resilience and growth through discomfort.
- **Weight Rucking**: He emphasizes the benefits of rucking (walking with a weighted pack), highlighting how this practice strengthens both body and mind, inspired by ancient human practices.

## The Intersection of Creativity and Physical Pursuits

Both Michael and I agree that there’s a significant overlap between physical exertion and creative output. Whether through writing, exploring, or physical fitness, the challenges we face fuel our creativity and thought processes. The struggles we endure in the body often parallel those in the mind.

## Closing Thoughts

Michael shares how these experiences have led to a deeper understanding of life and self, equipping him to navigate daily challenges with more resilience. The conversation wraps up with encouragement for everyone to embrace discomfort, lean into hard things, and ultimately live life to the fullest.
