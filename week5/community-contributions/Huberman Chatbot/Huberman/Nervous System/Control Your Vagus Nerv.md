# Control Your Vagus Nerve to Improve Mood, Alertness & Neuroplasticity

Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are diving deep into the fascinating world of the vagus nerve.

## What is the Vagus Nerve?

The vagus nerve, also known as cranial nerve 10, is an extensive nerve that plays a crucial role in connecting the brain and body. Unlike other nerves that may only link specific areas, the vagus nerve encompasses a vast network that can be thought of as its own nervous system within the central nervous system. 

### Key Functions of the Vagus Nerve
- **Extensive Pathway**: Links the brain to various organs across the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and lower intestines.
- **Sensory and Motor Integration**: Transmits both sensory information from the body to the brain and motor information from the brain to the body.
- **Actionable Tools**: You can control and stimulate the vagus nerve using simple techniques to improve mood, alertness, and neuroplasticity.

## The Evolving Understanding of the Vagus Nerve

In recent years, research has significantly advanced our understanding of how to control the vagus nerve. It can help with:
- **Increased Alertness**: Without the need for pharmaceuticals, you can stimulate your brain's alertness.
- **Rapid Relaxation**: You can calm down quickly on demand using specific techniques.
- **Mood Improvement**: Enhance your mood and learning ability.

## Separating Teaching and Personal Podcasting

Before we get further into the science, I want to clarify that this podcast is separate from my academic roles and is aimed at providing zero-cost, science-based information to the broader public. As part of this mission, today’s episode includes sponsorships.

### Sponsor: Element
Element is an electrolyte drink containing necessary electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and potassium but no sugar. Staying hydrated is critical for optimal brain and body function. **Recommendation**: Dissolve one packet of Element in 16-32 ounces of water, especially when exercising or on hot days.

### Sponsor: JW
JW produces medical-grade red light therapy devices that can enhance cellular health, muscle recovery, and skin health. **Personal Use**: I use JW devices several times a week to support my health.

## Structure of the Vagus Nerve

The vagus nerve is unique:
- **Connections**: Receives and provides connections across the body, from the head and neck to the chest and abdomen.
- **Anatomy**: Contains a mixed population of sensory and motor neurons, making its functions diverse.

### Understanding Sensory and Motor Information

1. **Sensory Information**: 
   - Collected from organs and sent to the brain (e.g., information about gut acidity or heart rate).
2. **Motor Information**:
   - Commands from the brain to organs to control functions (e.g., gut contractions, heart rate modulation).

## Instruments of Control: Actionable Tools

To access the benefits of the vagus nerve, it's important to understand the specific pathways involved in:
- **Calming Effects**: How relaxation can be achieved via the sensory pathways.
- **Energizing Effects**: Discovering how motor pathways can enhance alertness.

### Accessing the Vagus Nerve for Health Benefits

#### 1. **Proactive Tools for Relaxation and Learning**
- **Physiological Sigh**: Two inhales followed by a long exhale can significantly activate the vagus nerve.

#### 2. **Exercise**
- Engaging in physical activity, particularly strength training or high-intensity workouts, can stimulate the vagus nerve and enhance mental alertness.

#### 3. **Breathing Techniques**
- Deep, extended exhalations boost heart rate variability, improving your auto-regulation capabilities.

### Improving Gut-Brain Connection

1. **Serotonin Production**:
   - The gut produces 90% of the body’s serotonin, which is crucial for mood and gut health. Keeping serotonin levels balanced ensures good mental health.

2. **Microbiota and Diet**:
   - Consumption of low sugar fermented foods (e.g., kimchi, yogurt) and adequate tryptophan are crucial for promoting gut health and serotonin production.

## Practical Strategies for Vagus Nerve Activation

### Methods to Calm Down
1. **Mechanical Activation**:
   - Stretching and turning the head can help activate the vagus nerve pathways.
2. **Humming Practice**:
   - Proper humming can facilitate vagus nerve activation. Extend the "H" sound to create a calm, resonating effect.
3. **Gargling**: 
   - Engaging in gargling activates the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation.

## The Overall Importance of the Vagus Nerve 

The vagus nerve is integral to numerous bodily functions ranging from mood enhancement to alertness and learning. By understanding this nerve, its pathways, and how to control them, we can significantly improve our health and performance.
