# **How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness**

Dr. Andy Galpin, a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton, joined Andrew Huberman on the Huberman Lab Guest Series to discuss the science and application of methods to enhance strength, speed, endurance, hypertrophy, and other aspects of fitness, exercise, and sports performance. This series aims to detail the mechanisms, logic, and specific protocols for achieving various exercise adaptations, including how to create combined programs, optimise nutrition and recovery, and assess fitness levels.

### **Understanding and Assessing Fitness**

People generally pursue two main goals when it comes to exercise: **aesthetics** (e.g., wanting to be big, lean, or avoid being too big) and **functionality** (e.g., improving strength, mobility, or daily energy levels). The ultimate aim is to achieve immediate fitness goals while ensuring long-term wellness. To do this effectively, it's crucial to understand the major components of physical fitness. The core principle is that "the methods are many, but the concepts are few".

#### **The Nine Major Adaptations of Physical Fitness**

Exercise induces incredible adaptations across various organ systems, including the nervous system, muscle, and connective tissue. Dr. Galpin categorises these physiological adaptations into nine key areas:

1. **Skill or Technique**: Learning to move more efficiently, with specific position, timing, and sequence. This includes improving running form or practising sports skills like swinging a golf club.  
2. **Speed**: Moving at a higher velocity or with better acceleration. For most individuals, pure speed is not typically necessary to test, as it can often be inferred from power tests.  
3. **Power**: Defined as speed multiplied by force.  
4. **Force or Strength**: The maximum amount of force you can produce or the maximum weight you can move one time. This is distinct from muscular endurance.  
5. **Muscle Hypertrophy (Muscle Size)**: An aesthetic outcome focused on increasing muscle dimensions. This is the first adaptation on the list that relates to appearance rather than a functional outcome.  
6. **Muscular Endurance**: The ability to perform multiple repetitions of a movement, typically in the range of 5 to 50 repetitions, such as the number of push-ups or sit-ups one can do. This adaptation is typically localised to specific muscle groups.  
7. **Anaerobic Capacity**: A total physiological limitation, representing the maximum amount of all-out work one can do in a short burst, typically 30 to 120 seconds, leading to tremendous global fatigue. This is often synonymous with maximal heart rate.  
8. **Maximal Aerobic Capacity (VO2 Max)**: The maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilise during intense exercise, typically reached after 8 to 15 minutes of sustained effort. VO2 max is calculated by multiplying cardiac output (heart rate x stroke volume) by the arterial-venous oxygen difference (how much oxygen is taken up by muscles).  
9. **Long Duration (Steady State Training)**: The ability to sustain sub-maximal work for an extended period, without breaks or reduction in output. This usually means maintaining effort for over 15 minutes, with typical sessions lasting 20 to 60 minutes or longer.

**Fat loss and general health benefits** are considered byproducts of these nine adaptations, not specific training styles themselves. For instance, certain protocols among the nine are effective for fat loss, and general health is achieved by having sufficient strength, cardiovascular fitness, and muscle mass. What constitutes a "health-based protocol" depends on an individual's current status and limitations within these nine fitness areas.

#### **Comprehensive Fitness Assessment**

To understand one's level of fitness across these nine categories, there are numerous tests available. Dr. Galpin suggests a combination of scientific gold standards (if resources are unlimited) and cost-free, equipment-free methods accessible to anyone.

Here are recommended assessments for each category:

* **1\. Movement Skill**:

  * **Gold Standard**: Consult a highly qualified physical therapist or movement specialist to identify and assess movement patterns (e.g., overhead pressing, squatting, running).  
  * **Cost-Free Method**: Self-record representative movements (upper-body press/pull, lower-body press/pull like push-ups, pull-ups/bent rows, squats, deadlifts) from frontal and side views (3-10 slow, controlled repetitions). Look for four key things at each major joint (shoulder, elbow, low back, hip, knee, ankle):  
    * **Symmetry**: Is one limb moving further or turning differently than the other?  
    * **Stability**: Can the movement be performed slowly and with control without shaking or sliding (e.g., pausing at the bottom of a squat)?  
    * **Awareness**: Can the movement flaw be corrected simply by being made aware of it (e.g., keeping heels on the ground during a squat)?  
    * **Range of Motion**: Is the joint moving through a full, general range of motion without compromising other joints?  
  * **Scoring**: Roughly categorise as "terrible" (high acute risk, score 0), "minor flaw" (needs caution, score 1), or "good" (reasonable protocol can be followed, score 3).  
* **2\. Speed**:

  * Not generally necessary for most people to test. Can be inferred from power tests.  
* **3\. Power**:

  * **Cost-Free Methods**:  
    * **Broad Jump**: Stand still, jump as far forward as possible, measure distance from start line to the back of the heel. **Target**: Your body height (e.g., 5'5" jump for a 5'5" person). For females, this target is about 15% lower.  
    * **Vertical Jump**: Measure standing reach (two hands, middle fingers touching, directly overhead) against a wall. Then jump with two hands and touch as high as possible, measuring the difference. **Target**: 24 inches (61 cm) or higher for men, closer to 20 inches (51 cm) for men over 50, and about 15% lower for females.  
  * **Gold Standard**: Use a force plate for vertical jump analysis (measures force, rate of force development, impulse, and speed) or a velocity transducer on a barbell to create a force-velocity curve at various loads (40-100% of 1RM). This helps identify specific power deficiencies.  
* **4\. Strength**:

  * **Grip Strength**:  
    * **Hand Grip Dynamometer**: Cost-effective device to measure grip strength. **Target**: Minimum 40 kg for men, ideally over 60 kg; minimum 35 kg for women, ideally over 50 kg. Aim for no more than 10% variation between hands.  
    * **Dead Hang**: Hang from a pull-up bar. **Target**: Minimum 30 seconds, good is 30-50 seconds, happy at over 60 seconds. Women often perform well here.  
  * **Leg Strength**:  
    * **Leg Extension**: **Target**: One repetition with your body weight (e.g., 170 lbs person should lift 170 lbs). For every decade past 40, this target can decrease by about 10%.  
    * **Goblet Squat Hold**: Hold about half of your body weight (kettlebell or dumbbell) in front of your chest, squat to the bottom position, and hold. **Target**: Hold for about 45 seconds while maintaining good position (for an intro, one-third body weight for 30 seconds). This assesses position, core strength, and low back stability.  
  * **General Strength Testing Notes**:  
    * **Technical Proficiency**: Only perform maximal strength tests if comfortable with technique to avoid acute injury.  
    * **Warm-up Protocol**: Standardise your warm-up for consistent results.  
    * **Repetition Conversion Equations**: Instead of a true 1-rep max, perform a set of 1 to 5 repetitions at a heavy load and use online calculators to estimate your 1RM.  
* **5\. Hypertrophy (Muscle Mass)**:

  * **Body Composition Tests**: Use DEXA scans (gold standard) or bioelectrical impedance.  
  * **Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI)**: Use online calculators with your total body weight, body fat percentage, and height. **Target**: 20 or higher for men, 18 or higher for women (assuming sub 30% body fat for men, sub 35% for women). Below 17 for men or 15 for women indicates insufficient muscle mass, which is physiologically detrimental.  
* **6\. Muscular Endurance**:

  * **Plank**: Hold a front plank for 60 seconds or a side plank for 45 seconds.  
  * **Push-ups**: Perform consecutive push-ups with full range of motion (full lockout at top, chest near ground at bottom). No pauses. **Target**: 25+ consecutive push-ups for men (10 is red flag, 10-25 needs work); 15+ consecutive push-ups for women (5-15 needs work, sub 5 indicates a strength problem).  
  * **75% of 1RM Repetitions**: Take one of your strength tests (e.g., leg extension), load it to 75% of your 1RM, and perform as many repetitions as possible. **Target**: More than 8 repetitions.  
* **7\. Anaerobic Capacity**:

  * **Gold Standard**: Wingate Test (30-second maximal effort in a lab) or Bosco Protocol (60 seconds of maximal vertical jumps on a force plate).  
  * **Practical Method**: Perform a 30-45 second maximal effort on an air bike, rower, or sprinting. Focus on **heart rate recovery**. After reaching maximal exertion, your heart rate should recover by approximately:  
    * **30 beats per minute within 60 seconds**.  
    * **60 beats per minute within 120 seconds**.  
    * Recovery worse than these numbers indicates a problem with anaerobic or cardiovascular capacity.  
* **8\. Maximal Aerobic Capacity (VO2 Max)**:

  * **Gold Standard**: Laboratory VO2 max test with a mask collecting gases.  
  * **Practical Methods**:  
    * **12-Minute Cooper's Test**: Run as far as possible in 12 minutes and record the distance. Use online calculators to estimate VO2 max.  
    * **1-Mile Walk Test**: Walk one mile at a submaximal pace, record time and heart rate at the end, and use online calculators to estimate VO2 max.  
  * **VO2 Max Targets**: **Minimum** 35 ml/kg/min for men, 30 ml/kg/min for women. **Ideal** target is above 50 ml/kg/min for men, and above 50 ml/kg/min for women. High-level endurance athletes can reach 70-80 ml/kg/min or higher.  
* **9\. Long Duration (Steady State)**:

  * **Practical Method**: Pick a consistent activity (e.g., running, cycling) and maintain work output for over **20 minutes with no breaks, intervals, or downtime**. Ideally, perform this with nasal breathing only. Walking only counts if it is genuinely challenging.

#### **Scheduling and Frequency of Assessments**

It's recommended to perform a **full battery of these tests once a year** as a minimum, or ideally every six months, similar to getting annual health check-ups and bloodwork. The most problematic area should be tested more frequently (e.g., monthly if VO2 max is very low).

**To arrange the tests**:

* Start with **non-fatiguing tests** like body composition (FFMI) and movement skill assessments, ensuring a 48-hour rest period prior to body composition tests to avoid acute exercise influencing results.  
* Group **skill, maximum strength, and power tests** at the beginning of a day when fresh. For example, broad jump, vertical jump, and leg strength tests can be done together.  
* Muscular endurance tests can follow strength tests on the same day after a 15-20 minute break (e.g., 1-rep max leg extension followed by 75% 1RM reps).  
* **Anaerobic capacity and VO2 max tests** should ideally be performed on separate days due to their fatiguing nature. Long-duration tests can serve as a warm-up for anaerobic tests, or they can be done on separate days.  
* The more separation between tests, the better the data, but grouping them can save time. The key is consistency in testing protocol to measure progress.

### **The History of Exercise Science and Its Influence**

The way people think about exercise today is heavily influenced by historical developments in exercise science. Early on, in the late 1880s and even at the Harvard Fatigue Lab (1927-1947), there was advocacy for a **combination of strength training and endurance**.

However, major shifts occurred in the mid-20th century:

* **1953-1954**: Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile, and Sir Edmund Hillary summited Everest. These endurance feats inspired a "runner's boom" in the 1960s and 70s, leading to the formation of the **American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)**, which focused heavily on clinical exercise and endurance.  
* **Fear of Strength Training**: For about 70 years, strength training was viewed with suspicion due to the death of a proponent, George Winship, from a heart attack at age 50\. Figures like Peter Karpovich initially perpetuated myths that strength training caused inflexibility or was bad for kids. However, after witnessing strength athletes perform impressive feats, Karpovich reversed his stance, conducting studies that proved the safety and benefits of strength training in the 1950s. Despite this, it didn't gain widespread traction initially.  
* **1977 and Beyond: The Arnold Effect**: The release of Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Pumping Iron" (followed by "Conan" and "The Terminator") transformed public perception of weight training. It made the idea of physical transformation accessible, leading to an explosion of gyms and a focus on **bodybuilding for aesthetic changes**. The **National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA)** was formed in 1978, dedicating itself to strength and conditioning science.  
* **Problems with Bodybuilding Dominance**: This era led to common, often incorrect, assumptions in training, such as the belief that muscles need extensive recovery (cannot be trained back-to-back days) or that cardio "ruins gains". Bodybuilding protocols often involved long, isolated, high-volume sessions, leading to injuries and a lack of overall fitness (e.g., poor cardiovascular health).  
* **Rise of Group Exercise and CrossFit**: These movements emerged as a solution, offering shorter, more movement-based workouts that provided multiple adaptations simultaneously and improved general fitness. However, this often came at the cost of de-emphasising movement quality in favour of scores, leading to safety concerns and burnout.

**Today, the pendulum is slowly shifting towards the middle**. This allows for the selection of optimal protocols from various training styles (powerlifting for strength, weightlifting for power, CrossFit for well-roundedness) to achieve specific, desired adaptations without unwanted side effects.

#### **Case Studies Illustrating Specificity of Adaptation**

Two key studies highlight how training specificity influences fitness outcomes:

* **Swedish Cross-Country Skiers Study**: Dr. Galpin studied 80-90-year-old competitive cross-country skiers in Stockholm who had been training consistently for 50-60 years. Compared to non-exercising Americans of the same age, the Swedish skiers had **remarkably higher VO2 max levels** (average 35-38 ml/kg/min, comparable to a normal college male; one 92-year-old had 38 ml/kg/min, a world record for his age). Their resting heart rates were typically **sub-60 beats per minute**. This clearly demonstrated the immense benefits of consistent endurance exercise for cardiovascular health, resting heart rate, and blood pressure.

  * **The Downside**: Despite their exceptional cardiovascular fitness, their **leg strength and functionality were no better than their non-exercising counterparts**. This indicates that lifelong endurance training alone is insufficient for overall global health, particularly for strength.  
* **Monozygous (Identical) Twin Study**: In a perfect natural experiment, Dr. Galpin studied identical twins where one was a lifelong endurance athlete (runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman competitor) and the other was sedentary.

  * **Endurance Benefits**: The exercising twin showed significantly better lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, and VO2 max, mirroring the findings from the Swedish study.  
  * **Strength and Muscle Mass**: Despite the vast difference in activity, their **total muscle mass was almost identical**. The non-exercising twin was slightly fatter, accounting for body weight differences. Surprisingly, the **non-exercising twin often favoured in strength tests** such as grip strength, vertical jump, and leg extension power.  
  * **Muscle Fiber Type Adaptation**: The study showed a dramatic shift in muscle fiber type due to training. In the quadriceps, typically 50/50 fast-twitch and slow-twitch, the sedentary twin was normal (50% slow-twitch, 20% hybrid fibres), while the endurance-trained twin had **95% slow-twitch fibers**. This demonstrates the profound physiological adaptation potential with consistent, specific training over decades. Fast-twitch fibers are crucial for strength and preventing falls in aging, and their reduction is a hallmark of aging if not actively trained.

These studies underscore that **specialisation leads to lopsided fitness**, where one excels in trained areas but may be deficient in others. To achieve optimal health and functionality, a combination of training types is necessary.

#### **Women and Resistance Training**

The adoption of weight training by women has been a slower process than for men. While impressive female athletes and actresses exist, the popular stimulus for widespread adoption among young women is still evolving. However, there's a growing understanding of the benefits, particularly for offsetting bone density loss. Within the scientific and coaching communities, female involvement in exercise science is growing rapidly. Furthermore, **NIH mandates now require the inclusion of women in scientific research**, recognising that excluding them for decades based on false assumptions (e.g., about menstrual cycles affecting data) was flawed. The next crucial step is securing funding for **high-performance research specifically for female-centric questions**, focusing on issues unique to female athletes like the impact of birth control on performance and recovery, for which there is currently almost no information.

### **Conclusion**

Assessing fitness across all nine adaptations is incredibly valuable not just for athletes but for anyone seeking aesthetic changes, improved functionality, and longevity. It helps identify "performance anchors" – areas of severe weakness that limit overall potential. By addressing these limitations, one can achieve better overall health and continue to pursue specific passions in training more effectively. The journey through exercise science history reveals that no single training paradigm is complete, and the future of effective exercise involves intelligently combining the best protocols from diverse disciplines to achieve desired adaptations.
