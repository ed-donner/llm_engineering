## Summary

I currently serve as a Quantitative Analytics Specialist within Wells Fargo's Model Risk Management (MRM) team at India and Philippines. My primary responsibility involves validating AI/ML models, with a focus on fraud detection, as well as models used in marketing, credit scoring, and natural language processing (NLP). In this role, I ensure the conceptual soundness of models, conduct performance testing, conduct explainability analysis and rigorously challenge models by developing challenger models to detect weaknesses.

Additionally, I ensure compliance with regulatory standards set by Wells Fargo, in alignment with guidelines from the Federal Reserve and the OCC. I work closely with model development and risk management teams, providing validation feedback and recommending improvements. I also contribute to documentation and reporting, preparing validation reports, and ensuring the ongoing monitoring of model performance.

With a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and High-Performance Computing gained during my graduate studies at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I bring a unique blend of skills at the intersection of advanced technology and engineering. My expertise allows me to tackle complex challenges, drive innovation, and contribute to cutting-edge solutions in diverse industries.
