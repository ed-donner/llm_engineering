**Three New Summary Markdown Files**

Copy and paste these three markdown files to existing knowledge-base folders.

Re-run ingest.py in pro_implementation folder.

Run app.py to test it is working well, e.g. how much is the total contract value of Healthllm.

Re-run evaluator.py and grab a coffee ☕

* **Employee Summary: [employee-details-summary.md](employee-details-summary.md)** - A summary of Insurellm's employee full name, salary, and location details.

* **Performance Summary: [employee-performance-summary.md](employee-performance-summary.md)** - A summary of Insurellm's employee performance highlights which contain numerical figures such as Alex Chen "reduced system downtime by **30%** over six months through scaling backend services".

* **Contract Summary: [contract-summary.md](contract-summary.md)** - A summary of Insurellm's contract details with a focus on the numerical components.  For example it has the following summary of the Healthllm product's "**Known Total Contract Value**: **$3,510,000**, **Active Contracts**: 4":

  - WellCare Insurance Co. (Essential Tier): $8,000/mo × 12 mo = **$96,000**  
  - United Healthcare Alliance (Enterprise Tier): **$2,784,000** (48 mo)  
  - Harmony Health Plans (Professional Tier): $15,000/mo × 24 mo = **$360,000**  
  - Advantage Medical Coverage: $15,000/mo × 18 mo = **$270,000**
