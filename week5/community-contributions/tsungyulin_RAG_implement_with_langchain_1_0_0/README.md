# LangChain RAG Implementation Example (v1.0.0)

This example demonstrates how to implement a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** application using **LangChain version 1.0.0**.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites

You must first install the `uv` package to manage dependencies and your virtual environment efficiently.

```bash
# Install uv (if you haven't already)
pip install uv
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use the `uv sync` command. This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary packages defined for the project.

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Configuration

Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory and include your OpenAI API key:

```Ini
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

### 4. Run the Application

Execute the main script to run the RAG application:

```bash
python main.py
```
