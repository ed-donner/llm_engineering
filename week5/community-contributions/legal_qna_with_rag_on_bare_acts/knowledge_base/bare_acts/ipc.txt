only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the
boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence,
though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of
fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C.
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention
in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so
imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.
82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under
seven years of age.
83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.—Nothing is an
offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained
sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that
occasion.
84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the
time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that
he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication,
incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to
law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or
against his will.
86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person
who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge
as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by
consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the
doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, 
26
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent,
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which
in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.
88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.—
Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or
be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose
benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that
harm, or to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint,
but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A
has committed no offence.
89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—
Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound
mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of
that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause
or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided—
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the
attempting to cause death;
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing
it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous
hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the
attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt; or
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing
of which offence it would not extend.
Illustration
A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to
be likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception,
inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.
90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as
is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a
misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent
was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or
Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or
intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or
Consent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person
who is under twelve years of age.
91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in
sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they
may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or
on whose behalf the consent is given.
Illustration
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is an offence
independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of
such harm”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. 
27
92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by
reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without
that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent,
or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of
him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided—
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the
attempting to cause death;
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it
knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to
cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of
which offence it would not extend.
Illustrations
(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's
death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed
no offence.
(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z,
and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence.
(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed.
There is no time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in
good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence.
(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop,
knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's
benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.
Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92.
93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by
reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.
Illustration
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the
shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death.
94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State
punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by
threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person
will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a
reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which
he became subject to such constraint.
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a
gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of
his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a
thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of
a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception.
95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to
cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.
Of the Right of Private Defence
96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the
right of private defence. 
28
97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the
restrictions contained in section 99, to defend—
First.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human
body;
Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against
any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or
which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.
98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act,
which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of
maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by
reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence
against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.
Illustrations
(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private
defence which he would have if Z were sane.
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A.
Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z,
which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception.
99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence
against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or
attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act
may not be strictly justifiable by law.
There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension
of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in
good faith under colour of his office though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law.
There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of
the public authorities.
Extent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the
inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose ofdefence.
Explanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or
attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the
person doing the act is such public servant.
Explanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or
attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that
the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which
he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.
100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of
private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the
voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the
exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—
First.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the
consequence of such assault;

29
1
[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid
which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of
such act.]
101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of
any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body
does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions
mentioned in section 99 to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.
102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of
private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises
from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it
continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.
103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of
private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary
causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the
attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions

Thirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is
used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property;

risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk.
Illustration
A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing
on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if
by so firing he harms any of the children.
CHAPTER V
OF ABETMENT
107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who—
First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or
Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that
thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of
that thing; or
Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material
fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing
to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
Illustration
A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is
not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the
apprehension of C.
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in
order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid
the doing of that act.
108. Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing
an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although
the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.
Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should
be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.
Illustrations
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of
instigating B to commit murder.
Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an
offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor or any guilty
intention or knowledge.
 
31
Illustrations
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or
not, is guilty of abetting an offence.
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death.
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to
the punishment provided for that offence.
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is
also an offence.
Illustration
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in
consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.
Illustration
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and
procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.

[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the
meaning of this Code who, in 2
[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2
[India]
which would constitute an offence if committed in 2
[India].
Illustration
A, in 2
[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.]
109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no
express provision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is
committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which
constitutes the abetment.
Illustrations
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B
accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.

1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3.
2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch.,
to read as above. 
32
(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting
that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.
(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he
may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s
death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.
110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of
abettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a
different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for
the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge
of the abettor and with no other.
111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an act is abetted
and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent
as if he had directly abetted it:
Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the
influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the
abetment.
Illustrations
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of
the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under
the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable
in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y.
(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though
guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable
consequence of the burning.
(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with
arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder
was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder.
112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act
for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted,
and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences.
Illustration
A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence resists that distress. In offering the
resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of
resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and,
if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each
of the offences.
113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by
the abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular
effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect
from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the
same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the
act abetted was likely to cause that effect.
Illustration
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in
consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the
punishment provided for murder.
114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person who is absent would be
liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in
consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.
 
33
115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life—if offence not
committed.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1
[imprisonment for
life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is
made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine;
if act causing harm be done in consequence.—and if any act for which the abettor is liable in
consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable
to fine.
Illustration
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the
punishment of death or 1

191. Giving false evidence.—Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of
law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement

admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence.
(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when
he does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false
evidence.
(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of
Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore,
although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence.
(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not
knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not.

arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause
any person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous
opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding is said “to fabricate false evidence”.
Illustrations

fabricated false evidence.
(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting,
purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the
officers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence.
193. Punishment for false evidence.—Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a
judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial

CHAPTER XVI
OF OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY
Of offences affecting life
299. Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death,
or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that
he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.
Illustrations
(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to
be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable
homicide.
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death,
induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable
homicide.
(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there.
Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause
death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.
Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder,
disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused
his death.

1. Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2.
2. Subs. by the A. O. 1950, for “His Majesty’s subjects”.
3. Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, s. 3, for certain words (w.e.f. 27-9-1961).
4. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”.
73
Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury
shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment
the death might have been prevented.
Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may
amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought
forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.
300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by
which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or—
2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely
to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or—
3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury
intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or—
4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all
probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without
any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
Illustrations
(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention
of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is
labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of
health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such
bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.
(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature.
Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.
(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although
he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.
Exception 1.—When culpable homicide is not murder.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the
offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death
of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:—
First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for
killing or doing harm to any person.
Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public
servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.
Thirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of
private defence.
Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from
amounting to murder is a question of fact.
Illustrations
(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder,
inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in
doing an act caused by the provocation.
(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing
himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable
homicide. 
74
(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder,
inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.
(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has
perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.
(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing
so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was
giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and
to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only
culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.
Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the
right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the
death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and
without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.
Illustration
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the
assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has
not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.
Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a
public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and
causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due
discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is
caused.
Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden
fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first
assault.
Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above
the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.
Illustration
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's
youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.
301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was
intended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death,
commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows
himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of
which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew
himself to be likely to cause.
302. Punishment for murder.—Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death, or
1
[imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine.
303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of 1
[imprisonment
for life], commits murder shall be punished with death.
304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable
homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with 1
[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by
which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as
is likely to cause death;

1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). 
75
or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with
both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to
cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.
1
[304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash
or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.]

Of Criminal Force and Assault
349. Force.—A person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or
cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or
cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other's body, or with
anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that
other's sense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of
motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter
described:
First.—By his own bodily power.
Secondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of
motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person.
Thirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move.
350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent,
in order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to
be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the
force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.
Illustrations
(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the
stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is
produced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so
without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will
cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.
(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of
motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's
consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.
(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of
motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally,
without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z.
(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring
it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or
knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.
(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's
clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried
by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A
has used force to Z; and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal
force to Z.
(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent
intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.
(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power
causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact
must affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent
intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.
(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses
criminal force to Z.
351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely
that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that
gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.
Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give
to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an
assault.
Illustrations
(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike
Z. A has committed an assault.
(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to
believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. 
83
(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to
an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture
explained by the words may amount to an assault.
352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever
assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by
that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.
Explanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under
this section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the
offence, or
if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the
lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or
if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
 Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact.
353. Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty.—Whoever
assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such
public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public
servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful
discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for
a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the
dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may
dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.
(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's
consent. A has committed theft.
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a
goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has
not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A
dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.
(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he
may commit criminal misappropriation of property.
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear
of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the
intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the
ring, commits theft.
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for
which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand,
and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as
what he did was not done dishonestly.
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes
the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft,
inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.
(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he
borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he
obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.
(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express
consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived
that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.
(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it
is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed
theft.
(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such
property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.
(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession.
Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.
379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

98
When theft is robbery.—Theft is “robbery” if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in
committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the
offender, for that end voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful
restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.
When extortion is robbery.—Extortion is “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the
extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in
fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person,
and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted.
Explanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in
fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.
Illustrations
(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes, without Z's consent. Here A has
committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore
committed robbery.
(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has
extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence.
A has therefore committed robbery.
(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers
his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to
the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z.
(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us

Illustrations
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good faith believingat the time when he takes it, that the
property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property
to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express
consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has
not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right
to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his
own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the
meaning of this section.
Illustration
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z,
pledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this
section.
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes
such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or
misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined,
if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before
he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a
reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.

1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). 
100
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular
person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his
own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found.
Illustrations
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks up the rupee. Here A has not
committed the offence defined in this section.
(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the
note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of
the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque
was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section.
(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards
appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section.
(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and
appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section.
(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the
owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.
404. Dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his
death.—Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use property, knowing that such
property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person's decease, and has not since
been in the possession of any person legally entitled to such possession, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to
fine, and if the offender at the time of such person's decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant,
the imprisonment may extend to seven years.
Illustration
Z dies in possession of furniture and money. His servant A, before the money comes into the possession of any person
entitled to such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. A has committed the offence defined in this section.
Of criminal breach of trust
405. Criminal breach of trust.—Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any
dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or
dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in
which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made
touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal
breach of trust”.

shares in the Bank of Bengal, disobeys Z's directions, and buys shares in the Bank of Bengal, for Z, instead of buying Company's
paper, here, thought Z should suffer loss, and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A, on account of that loss, yet A,
not having acted dishonestly, has not committed criminal breach of trust.
(e) A, a revenue-officer, is entrusted with public money and is either directed by law, or bound by a contract, express or
implied, with the Government, to pay into a certain treasury all the public money which he holds. A dishonestly appropriates the

and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank
endorsement. B commits forgery.
(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated
six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to
Z. A has committed forgery.
(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the
will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.
(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed
circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false
document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.
(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under
Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or
implied contract for service.
Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.
Illustrations
(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same
name. A has committed forgery.
(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of
exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws
the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.
(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending
to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.
(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease
of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause
it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.
(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to
give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending
that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the
definition.
Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made
by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may
amount to forgery.
Illustration
A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate
it. A commits forgery.
