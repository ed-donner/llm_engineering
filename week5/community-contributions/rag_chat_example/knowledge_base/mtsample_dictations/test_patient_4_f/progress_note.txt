 ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

 Satisfactory three-week postpartum course, seasonal allergies.  We will try Patanol eyedrops and Allegra 60
 mg twice a day.  She was cautioned about the possibility that this may alter her milk supply.  She is to
 drink extra fluids and call if she has problems with that.  We will try ProctoFoam HC.  For the hemorrhoids,
 also increase the fiber in her diet.  That prescription was written, as well as one for Allegra and Patanol.
 She additionally will be begin on Micronor because she would like to protect herself from pregnancy until
 her husband get scheduled in and has a vasectomy, which is their ultimate plan for birth control, and she
 anticipates that happening fairly soon.  She will call and return if she continues to have problems with allergies.
 Meantime, rechecking in three weeks for her final six-week postpartum checkup.
